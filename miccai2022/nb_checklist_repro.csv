519-Paper1253	TransEM: Residual Swin-Transformer based regularized PET image reconstruction				The authors made an effort to make their paper reproductible, which lots of setup values. I did not find in the paper or in supplementary material a way to access the code, whereas it seems to be done according to the reproducibility checklist filled in by the authors. Maybe this is not possible at this stage. The authors detailed the hyperparameters values of the neural network, of the method, and the initialization of the image, which is very important. However, were  several runs make ? Or was the initialization of the neural network weights fixed ? About the PET simulation, some simulation setup is missing, like the system matrix modelling, the number of line of responses.

570-Paper2080	White Matter Tracts are Point Clouds: Neuropsychological Score Prediction and Critical Region Localization via Geometric Deep Learning		By using the openly available data from the Human Connectome Project and a brief description of the statistics of the subjects used, reproducibility seems to be possible. In addition, the settings and software framework are described in Section 2.5. The authors' answers on the reproducibility checklist confirm the given reproducibility. It would be beneficial, if the code would be provided on github.
