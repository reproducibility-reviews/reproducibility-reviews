001	3D CVT-GAN: A 3D Convolutional Vision Transformer-GAN for PET Reconstruction	This work has novelty on extending 2D CVT to 3D CVT for building a 3D CVT-GAN to reconstruct SPET images from LPET images, which is helpful for diagnosis. Thus I recommend to accept now.	The novelty is the main concern.	A lot of similar methods have been proposed to tackle the standard-dose PET reconstruction from corresponding low-dose PET images, improvements on PSNR and SSIM are not the key factors to show the effectiveness of proposed method. The authors should consider how to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of proposed method on a larger dataset.
002	3D Global Fourier Network for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis using Structural MRI	Novelty of the method and convincing results.	Technical aspect.	"No results on MCI classification.
Not report AUC values."
003	4D-OR: Semantic Scene Graphs for OR Domain Modeling	"This paper is a good proof-of-concept of scene graph in the surgical field. Besides, a new dataset will be made public. Therefore, I recommend an ""accept""."	This paper brings interesting contributions, but it seems more as a proof of concept. Hence I recommend rejection and resubmission for a future MICCAI. The dataset used for evaluation does not seem clinically realistic (at least from the scarce details provided in the paper). The evaluation sections and discussions seem shallow and also lack information on how this approach could translate to clinical practice.	I think the paper would be stronger if the effect of data perturbation is analyzed more and also more information on scenarios captured for this dataset.
004	A Comprehensive Study of Modern Architectures and Regularization Approaches on CheXpert5000	Good complete work.	This overall appears to be a good paper with rigorous methodology and clearly presented results.  The results are of interest to the medical image analysis community at large. The paper would have been stronger if additional datasets were included in the analysis.	The paper is well organized and well written. The experiments are well constructed and thoroughly conducted. The methods are relevant and up-to-date.
005	A Deep-Discrete Learning Framework for Spherical Surface Registration	Please see my comments above.	Good evaluation and valuable method for a real-world problem. However, enthusiasm tempered by the two weaknesses noted above.	The authors' approach is interesting, addresses shortcommings or prior work, and is well explained in this paper.
006	A Geometry-Constrainted Deformable Attention Network for Aortic Segmentation	Good article, good study, but some correction to do.	"While results show some merit, a clear comparison for diameter meausurements is currently missing
In the current state, a solid round of editing is needed to increase readability of the manuscript.
The editing phase should also try to clarify all aspects in the methodology section to ensure reproducibility."	The method has high clinical application value in the field of medical image analysis  and also has strong experimental comparison.
007	A Hybrid Propagation Network for Interactive Volumetric Image Segmentation	This is a good paper that is of interest to the MICCAI community but has a minor weakness.	The problem is somewhat under-explored and the proposed method is evaluated on 4 datasets and it out-performs baseline methods on all 4 of them.	"This paper has merits but I am a bit concerned with the complexity/reproducibility of the method, as well as its applicability.
Since I also had a number of remarks on the clarity and experiments parts of the paper, I am leaning towards rejection."
008	A Learnable Variational Model for Joint Multimodal MRI Reconstruction and Synthesis	The theoretical analysis, the novelty w.r.t. application and the presented experimental results are advantageous for this work. However, the listed weakness of the work prevented a higher rating.	The authors provide a novel framework for joint reconstruction and image synthesis, which is of interest to radiologist. Though more evidence/analysis on different sampling patterns and acceleration rate is needed, this work is insightful and solid.	This paper proposes a learning algorithm with theoretical analysis, and the generation accuracy of reconstruction accuracy has been greatly improved. However, the main contribution of this paper has been proposed, so the innovation of this paper should be improved.
009	A Medical Semantic-Assisted Transformer for Radiographic Report Generation	This paper introduces the image-text matching task into the regional features used to extract images, and the addition of bilinear pools improves the high-order interaction between fine-grained features of images.	"The performance of the paper is good, and the problems this paper tends to solve are clear.
However, some modules are similar to previous works. Therefore, this paper may need to explain the differences. The experiment part is insufficient."	The paper proposes an elegant way to solve various problems pertaining to image captioning in medical imaging which usually looks very similar. Using higher order interaction for fine details coupled with memory slots improves the representation capabilities for report generation. Further the use of pseudo-medical concepts and RL help in pushing the performance further.
010	A Multi-task Network with Weight Decay Skip Connection Training for Anomaly Detection in Retinal Fundus Images	"Overall, this paper indeed proposed a new approach in this domain, however the contributions are limited and the experiments are not enough.
I will consider to improve my rating if the authors can address most of my concerns as stated in the weakness section."	This paper is well and logically written. The main contribution of this paper is that the authors proposed a novel U-Net architecture-based WDMT-Net with a weight decay training strategy and an auxiliary HOG prediction task to simultaneously combat the identity mapping problem and fully exploit the shared commonalities of normal fundus images. However, the description of the motivation for the auxiliary HOG prediction task is unclear and insufficient. Besides, appropriate state-of-the-art approaches for medical image reconstruction should also be reviewed and re-implemented as comparison methods.	The weak reject has been made till current manuscript due to the ambiguity of the motivation and importance of the discounted shortcut. Moreover, the experiments cannot justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
011	A New Dataset and A Baseline Model for Breast Lesion Detection in Ultrasound Videos	The use of the method for detection breast lesion in cases that it is know that a lesion is present requires justification.	Well justified and novel methodology. Excellent annotated data. Well done experiments and ablation studies. Offerning the annotated data and code to the community.	The anticipated dataset release was the main reason of my comments. The justification of the effectiveness of the proposed structure is limited.
012	A Novel Deep Learning System for Breast Lesion Risk Stratification in Ultrasound Images	The two factors that affected my decision were the unclarity of important issues in the methodology, and the inconsistent evaluation on the three datasets.	This paper is a solid approach for classifying malignant breast lesions. Probably most useful for clinical researchers and clinicians, but other medical vision researchers who work on multiclass learning tasks can also draw inspiration from this approach. Weaknesses are fairly minor.	The proposed method is novel, improves over baselines and has sound experimental validation. The results are validated on public datasets and ablation is conducted to show the utility of each component of the method.
013	A Novel Fusion Network for Morphological Analysis of Common Iliac Artery	Although the clinical hypothesis is meaningful, the paper lacks technical innovation. More importantly, the paper is the lacks evaluation related to comparing the quantitative results between anatomical information and the ground truth.	This paper has a clear motive and structure, and the network design is also innovative. There are details that can be improved and modified in the experimental section.	The proposed network that combines CNN and Swin Transformer is appealing. However, the task relevance of the method can be better designed.
014	A Novel Knowledge Keeper Network for 7T-Free But 7T-Guided Brain Tissue Segmentation	Lack of proper comparison results.	The simulation of 7T representations for 3T images is not clear.	I am confused about the practical application.
015	A Penalty Approach for Normalizing Feature Distributions to Build Confounder-Free Models	The proposed approach seems to be effective, however, more related work and a discussion on the assumptions implied in MDN are required.	The method is slightly beyond the MDN baseline and lacks the analysis of the proposed method. The experiment requires further comparisons between different other methods.	The writing and organization of this paper is clear. But some part of the paper does not follow the template (no keywords). The evaluation of this paper  is not enough, figure 3 only show the tSNE under some specific batch size.
016	A Projection-Based K-space Transformer Network for Undersampled Radial MRI Reconstruction with Limited Training Subjects	This is a very interesting approach with possible extensions in the future.	The recommendation is based on the method description and the results presentation.	While the presented method is novel, it was compared against previous models like U-Net that were designed for 2D images and not for handling radial scans of MRIs. As such, it is not possible to properly judge the merits of this method.
017	A Robust Volumetric Transformer for Accurate 3D Tumor Segmentation	Overall, the paper is well-written. The idea of designing a pure 3D transformer for medical image segmentation is interesting, this paper could be interesting to the audience of MICCAI 2022. My biggest concern is that no data augmentation is used in the experiments. This would affect all the comparison with other baselines.	Performance and Efficiency.	The performance of this network is great, but the content of this paper did not focus on the true contribution.
018	A Self-Guided Framework for Radiology Report Generation	The structure of the paper is very clear, the introduction is very detailed, and it is easy to reproduce.	The paper is novel interns of its pipeline and application.	Novel mechanism of using a mix of report and images for model training and using similarity comparer as QA step (alleviating need for humans for labelling or QA).
019	A Sense of Direction in Biomedical Neural Networks	This paper could be accepted on the basis of the novelty of the approach and the satisfying evaluation. However, it would greatly benefit from clearer writing.	I think the paper is very solid in its overall presentation, writing and evaluation. However, the improvements over MASC seem to be minor and as presented on the tested datasets, the proposed method is more of an alternative to MASC rather than addressing major drawbacks.	This paper integrates the information of the rotation and scale into a convolution neural network, which largely lightens the model parameters while achieving comparable or even better performance on three datasets. Nevertheless, a few points summarised in weaknesses and comments need clarification, e.g., what does the calibrated response shaping bring and how?
020	A Spatiotemporal Model for Precise and Efficient Fully-automatic 3D Motion Correction in OCT	"The give score is due to the proposed method being faster than alternatives, supposedly more accurate, and simper given the need for just a single mapping, which reverts on more simplicity, as well as more comfort for the patient.
However, I find the experiments section not to be as strong as it could have been. With proper experimentation and comparisons, utilizing hard numbers when comparing with alternatives, I would have definitely rated the paper higher."	The detailed explainations of the paper and the results seems good.	"1-The novelty paper should be more strong
2- the registration parameters are not described competently, for example in literature mentioned about Mutual information or SSD cost function. these should be included too
3-"
021	A Transformer-Based Iterative Reconstruction Model for Sparse-View CT Reconstruction	This paper proposed a novel hybrid network in unfolding manner, which combined convolution and transformer branches to simultaneously extract local and non-local regularization terms. However, more comparison results and ablation study were still needed to verify their main contributions.	This paper introduced transformer architecture into unrolling-based CT reconstruction network, proposed a novel module to extract deeper features, and achieved promising results.	Similar publications were found in literatures within the past five years. Everyone claimed nice results but not readily usable in clinic. Many authors did not understand the clinical requirement and only focus on algorithm parameter tuning. This manuscript is still following the old way though it includes detailed description of the network structures and results.
022	AANet: Artery-Aware Network for Pulmonary Embolism Detection in CTPA Images	The novel methodology and experiments	This paper describes the network structure and the experimental process completely, but the experimental results and discussion part are insufficient.The authors added artey-vein prior knowledge as a novel weight for PE segmentation, but did not compare with other methods.	The performance of the method is good, which outperforms existing methods, and the loss function mentioned could be generalized to other tasks. However, the study design could be improved (at least with better description in the paper).
023	Accelerated pseudo 3D dynamic speech MR imaging at 3T using unsupervised deep variational manifold learning	The demonstration of the developed algorithm in vivo is appealing. The lack of a gold standard reference is a challenging yet important step to accomplish and compare.	No fully sampled data is required for supervised training which is difficult to acquire for the speech MRI	The major factor is model novelty.
024	Accurate and Explainable Image-based Prediction Using a Lightweight Generative Model	I have chosen a strong accept, since I believe this to be a good paper, only with minor weakness. It is a well written document, the method is novel and it is illustrated in a useful and important application.	The main reason to accept is that it is a refreshing change of pace from the ever-more-complicated deep learners that dominate the landscape.  Carefully and thoughtfully evaluating a simple-minded alternative and its advantages is a unique contribution to the field.	"The paper proposes a simple framework for estimation of age and gender from brain images using a linear generative model as the likelihood function to derive a posterior for the covariate given the image. However, most methods (including those based on deep learning) are usually derived using a similar formulation (a likelihood term transforms into a ""loss function"") and the prior term turns into a ""regularization term"". Most Bayesian methods also use a similar framework and then optimize parameters. The proposed method is not very motivating or technically novel. Although both linear and non-linear benchmarks are used, and the paper proposes better predictive performance for low training samples, the performance of SFCN is consistently better than the proposed method. Moreover, the claims about a causal forward model are not substantiated with experiments showing if the proposed method provides any advantage compared to other baselines in interpretability and explainability."
025	Accurate and Robust Lesion RECIST Diameter Prediction and Segmentation with Transformers	While modest, the new model contributions are clear and yield state of the art performance. Clarity could be improved. While some ablation studies could be added, the current set of ablation experiments is pretty good.	"Overall, I am not fully convinced by the value of the method at hand:

Most importantly, many of the results seemed inconclusive, some remained unclear, and a few seemed inconsistent.
The idea in my perspective is current, but still has only limited novelty. The practical value of some of the method's concepts (e.g. the consistency loss) remained somewhat unclear to me.
Regarding these issues, the manuscript unfortunately does not provide a statistical evaluation, which could easily eliminate some of my reservations.
The sum of these issues combined with a variety of minor issues and the expected quality of MICCAI as a flagship conference therefore leads to my final recommendation."	"a transformer-based network (Meaformer, Measurement Transformer) for lesion RECIST diameter prediction and segmentation
(LRDPS), which involves three related and complementary tasks, including lesion segmentation, heat map prediction and key point regression."
026	Accurate Corresponding Fiber Tract Segmentation via FiberGeoMap Learner	Please refer to the comments in box 5.	This is a nicely designed method and shows a good result.	The paper proposes novel fiber tract segmentation approach including a novel geometric descriptor for fiber tracts and use of Transformers and self-attention for segmentation. The extensive evaluation shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, clinical application is demonstrated by comparing fiber density in autism versus controls.
027	ACT: Semi-supervised Domain-adaptive Medical Image Segmentation with Asymmetric Co-Training	The paper has good empirical results but lacks justification in the approach relating to the underlying distribution assumptions.	This paper proposes an interesting and novel idea to apply the co-training strategy to the SSDA problem. The performance is impressive. My concerns are (i) the experimental settings need more justification, (ii) some important technical details are missing in the manuscript, and (iii) the writing is not clear and needs to be improved.	The idea of the divide-and-conquer strategy for SSDA is well-motivated. The methodology and experiments are well-designed, and the results are promising for cross-modality segmentation. I highly suggest that the authors include more discussions on recent UDA and SSDA methods. Also, the authors should give more comparisons with these methods.
028	Adaptation of Surgical Activity Recognition Models Across Operating Rooms	"The first and second contributions are clearly trivial and straightforward. As for the 3rd contribution, pseudo label sampling, it is clearly functionally similar to distribution alignment which is proposed by AdaMatch. While the authors compared their method with AdaMatch in Table 2, I still encourage the authors to provide ablation studies on which one (distribution alignment vs pseudo label sampling) is the key.

Morevoer, I suspect that the slight disadvantages of AdaMatch compared with the proposed method may be attributed to the prediction cache (1st contribution). The authors are encouraged to also apply this trick to AdaMatch to fully justify the effectiveness of Pseudo Label sampling.

Overall, the technical novelities of this paper are weak and the experimental results do not properly justify the necessarity of the proposed pseudo label sampling."	The weaknesses of this paper are minors, it is very clear and provide all information to understand and reproduce the work. Moreover, it addresses an important issue in workflow recognition methods: the lack of generalization.	Limited technical contribution,  lack of information on the dataset and would like to see more metrics.
029	Adapting the Mean Teacher for keypoint-based lung registration under geometric domain shifts	The motivation is a little misleading with insufficient examples and experiments to support the arguments.	The method is novel, obtained very good results and the paper is very well written and presented.	"The paper deals with the area of UDA for registration which is underexplored.
The methods are new and solid, built upon well-validated approaches.
The experiments are through and the results are convincing."
030	Adaptive 3D Localization of 2D Freehand Ultrasound Brain Images	My main concern is the clinical motivation. The reason for developing the method is not convincing.	The original contribution is significant and has a wide scope for application and further improvements, maybe trackless 3D reconstruction if adequately validated.	In my opinion, working at datasets from different ultrasound machines is valuable. Especially when the goal is training novice sonographers. Although novelty of the work is not completely enough for MICCAI, but publication of the work will attract many attention in ultrasound community readers.
031	AdaTriplet: Adaptive Gradient Triplet Loss with Automatic Margin Learning for Forensic Medical Image Matching	The methodology of this work is concise and of elegant simplicity with good portability. It achieves significant results.	The method is novel, the analysis is comprehensive, the writing is clear, and the results are good.	Given the aforementioned points, I am currently opting for weak reject - while the paper is very well written, and both proposed methods are well motivated, the lack of comparison to the current Deep Metric Learning literature, as well as it not being clear to me how the proposed method in particular addresses the problem of FMIM make it hard to go for acceptance. I am however certainly open to have potential misunderstandings of mine pointed out during the rebuttal to update my score.
032	Addressing Class Imbalance in Semi-supervised Image Segmentation: A Study on Cardiac MRI	The main weakness is that the paper aims to improve the performance of the under-performing class, but the results do not show the benefits for the under-performing class. There are no results/discussions of the effects on the under-performing/minority class.	The paper focuses on a new training algorithm including a set of new mathematical formulation, and thus the methodological novelty is strong. The details of the experiments and parameter tuning is provided in the paper and in supplementary material. The method was well evaluated by comparing with other methods, and an ablation study was performed to show the effects of different components of the method. Finally, the result looks promising although the evaluation was only carried out on cardiac MRI datasets.	The application, the algorithm and the proposed strategy are tightly matched. It can be better after clarifying some details.
033	Adversarial Consistency for Single Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation	As mentioned in the strength section, this paper is satisfactory in the aspects of novelty, algorithm design, and experiments.	Although the method itself shows some merit, the paper overall is not clearly written. The experiments being insufficient to support the hypothesis of the paper mutes the excitement.	The organization of the paper is good. Some technical novelty.
034	Adversarially Robust Prototypical Few-shot Segmentation with Neural-ODEs	See the weaknesses section.	Novelty, presentation quality and experimental results.	"I think overall extending Neural ODE to enhance the adversarial robustness for FSS is interesting.
And the authors conducted extensive experiments and compare against a range of baseline to demonstrate the effectness."
035	Agent with Tangent-based Formulation and Anatomical Perception for Standard Plane Localization in 3D Ultrasound	Well written paper, clear description of the methodology.	The formulation of the SP localization is essential for optimizing the RL framework. This work proposes a new formulation for SP localization in RL. The proposed formulation is unrestricted by directional cosines coupling with less action space than the previous ones (6 < 8). The reward function encourage the agent to perceive anatomical information. The tangent point formulation has been applied in other image application such as 3d reconstruction of  fetal brain in MRI. In results of comparison experiments, the proposed method outperforms all of the others on the most of the metrics. For the ablation studies, performance of proposed model has no significant improvements especially in SSIM. but some designed module lack ablation studies.	The paper is well-organised, presents a novel methodology and mostly justifies the methods well, whether it be in the design choice stage or post-results; some small weaknesses are present (see above), which if addressed, would make the manuscript stronger.
036	Aggregative Self-Supervised Feature Learning from Limited Medical Images	The proposed method is of technical novelty, and the experiments are very comprehensive to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.	In general, the method in this paper is good enough for the MICCAI. It can bring more benefits by adding new SSL tasks into a pool for consideration. Though the experiment to compare with the standard method (training all SSL tasks together) is missing thus, it would not be comfortable to validate the effectiveness of this approach.	The overall method is well-designed, and my main concerns is the reported performance in the experiments. The performance of the baseline method SimCLR is lower than expected. For example, the accuracy of all the SSL baselines in Table 2 is almost the same as w/o SSL, which is inconsistent with results reported by existing works. Carefully tuning the hyperparameters of SimCLR may improve its performance and even outperform the proposed method. Therefore, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is not well evaluated in current experimental results.
037	An Accurate Unsupervised Liver Lesion Detection Method Using Pseudo-Lesions	A good, simple data augmentation trick that makes a big difference in at least one task (anomaly localization - so possibly useful for segmentation, too) is a valuable contribution to the community because it is easy to adopt.	The novelty is moderate, the paper lacks too many methodological details, which impairs the soundness of the study.	The paper shows how to use an unsupervised image translation technique (CycleGAN) to address the lack of paired data for accurate lesion detection. The AUC and other results show a demonstrated improvement of the proposed technique over other anomaly estimation baselines.
038	An adaptive network with extragradient for diffusion MRI-based microstructure estimation	Overall a decent paper. The technical difficulty is not high but good implementation and sufficient validations. A minor concern is marginal improvement in Fig. 3.	The manuscript is well-written and interesting to the MICCAI community. The method and the experimental design are sound.	The rating is based on the good performance of the proposed approach in dMRI microstructure estimation. As stated in previous sections, authors should resolve the several concerns in Q5 and Q8.
039	An Advanced Deep Learning Framework for Video-based Diagnosis of ASD	"The work introduces and releases a new dataset with accompanying model.
They do a thorough job of analysing the model and its performance. They also switch different components in/out of the architecture to assess their impact."	Although the paper lacks technical novelty, it has sound experimental setup and strong evaluation.	This work proposes a new dataset and pipeline for video based ASD detection. I think they are helpful for the community. However, the technical novelty is marginal. I prefer the weak reject as my rating at the current stage.
040	An End-to-End Combinatorial Optimization Method for R-band Chromosome Recognition with Grouping Guided Attention	The problem is defined well. Then, the proposed modules address these problems directly and successfully. Method description is proper and clear. The paper is written and organized well. Finally, the experiments are conducted properly including comparison with others and ablation studies. The contribution of the paper is shown clearly. There are just some minor weaknesses that can be addressed during rebuttals.	"*	The studied application is interesting and under-explored in the MICCAI community. 
*	The computational problem should be clearly described. 
*	The performance enhancement is modest."	The paper is generally well written and the problem is relevant for MICCAI. Some motivation for the problem is lacking and the paper can be slightly better organized. The authors are a bit liberal in the reproducibility report.
041	An Inclusive Task-Aware Framework for Radiology Report Generation	Paper is well written but need to answer a few question and clarify them with some reasonable justifications.	The main idea of this paper is to break down medical report into anatomical parts and generate the documents for each part instead of generate them as whole. This idea is adds small complexity while efficient to largely improve the performance.	novel approach
042	An Optimal Control Problem for Elastic Registration and Force Estimation in Augmented Surgery	The study addresses clinically relevant problem and the proposed method appears, in general, to be scientifically sound. However, before the manuscript can be accepted for publication, more detailed description of the methods used needs to be provided (see the comments in sections 5 and 8 of this review)) and specific description of how patient-specific material properties required by the proposed method can be reliably obtained in a clinical environment. It appears that this can be achieved by careful revision the manuscript without any need for obtaining additional results.	The method is clear and interesting, and the problem of finding the loads leading to a solution absolutely relevant. The major limiting factor is that the proposed method is not directly compared to other simulations or other loading approaches.	This method is very simple with no novelty. I suggest to utilize deep learning approaches
043	Analyzing and Improving Low Dose CT Denoising Network via HU Level Slicing	This is an idea that can be widely applied for many different neural networks and approaches, even for different applications. The enhancement of performance of the  is very significant.	"The topic of the paper is relevant and interesting to the MICCAI community.
It presents an innovative idea (HU level slicing ) that can be used in existing methods to enhance the denoising performance in Low Dose CT Denoising.

Some important information is missing in the experiments, but it's not complicated or expensive for authors to include it. This missing information affects to the reproducibility of the experiments.

The code is not available, but enough details to reproduce it are given."	The major factor for my recommendation is the novelty of the proposed method. HU level slicing is heuristic and validated with many different settings for robustness check. Theoretical analysis should be included for justification of using HU level slicing.
044	Analyzing Brain Structural Connectivity as Continuous Random Functions	"The creativity of the proposed solution to the atlas problem.
The clarity of the exposition."	The methodology novelty is good.	"Authors need to clarify their theoretical analytics and proof with more details.

Authors need to validate their proposed method with peer machine learning algorithms."
045	Anatomy-Guided Weakly-Supervised Abnormality Localization in Chest X-rays	The experiments are comprehensive and the results are strong. But the idea of using reports to aid disease localization in chest x-rays is not novel.	Good quality paper with a clear introduction of the method and well-organized experiments, though there are some possible improvements in the comparison study and evaluation data.	According to paper submission guidelines, for supplementary, authors should not submit text materials beyond figure and table captions, definition of variables in equations, or detailed proof of a theorem. The authors violated this guideline.
046	Anomaly-aware multiple instance learning for rare anemia disorder classification	Please see the weakness of this paper.	See above.	Both the strength and the weakness are obvious in this work. The strength is slightly over the weakness. I would recommend weak accept.
047	Assessing the Performance of Automated Prediction and Ranking of Patient Age from Chest X-rays Against Clinicians	The proposed method is motivated and the results are convince, expect for some issues. Currently, I recommend to accept and expect the replies in the rebuttal.	"The paper uses an impressive large dataset and some of the presented results are interesting. However, the clarity of the paper must be improved and some of the results are not reported correctly in figures and tables.
The description of the framework should also be extended so that relevant hyperparameters required for training the system are correctly described."	"The study is very interested. Well written organised. They deliver and answer their hypothesis questions. There is a novel idea of the network and how to combine GAN with regression models to predict the age of a patient from X-ray.
My only concern is in the human AI comparison.
The authors used test cohort for this which may include images from the six hospitals protocols whic the AI network already know through training. This si not a fair comparison with human experts. The authors need to compare in a cohort where the AI tool never show before the hospital's protocol modality resolution and quality of the images. By this way the comparison is fair with the human experts.
Please kindly answer the above question."
048	Asymmetry Disentanglement Network for Interpretable Acute Ischemic Stroke Infarct Segmentation in Non-Contrast CT Scans	The paper has significant strengths, an intuitive idea, clear presentation. It has weaknesses, but the strengths outweigh them I believe.	"Good presentations of a sophisticated approach. 
However, some details and potential issues need clarifications."	Overall a nice paper, the idea to utilise dientanglement to separate symmetries is interesting, I think its a paper that looks to exploit the available data and at the same time improve current models so I did enjoy reading it.
049	Atlas-based Semantic Segmentation of Prostate Zones	"The idea of building the voxel-wise probabilistic atlas to help the network capture anatomy prior is interesting, and the author has explained their approach clearly. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance against the baselines as well as some other methods. 
However, as mentioned in Question 5, some weaknesses affect the judgment of the contribution with this work."	Good paper, relevant topic but a concern that needs to be addressed.	While the approach has merit, the fact that the prostate segmentation is needed in order to segment the central gland reduces the enthusiasm for this work.
050	Atlas-powered deep learning (ADL) - application to diffusion weighted MRI	Good paper with solid results. Reproducibility could be improved by sharing the code.	Overall, I find the paper interesting but brought a bit downwards by novelty and some missing parts in the methods, thus my recommendation of weak reject	I think this is a fair conference paper, given the novel contribution of combining different aspects of atlases with DL for solving a widely practical problem of scalar diffusion and microstructure estimation from dMRI. Despite the limitations and comments I raised, this paper is valuable for discussing during the conference.
051	Attention mechanisms for physiological signal deep learning: which attention should we take?	While the paper does not propose new methods, the authors identify an area of the literature that has been scarcely investigated and perform an intuitive and interpretable experiment. The experiment is likely to be of use to other researchers who seek to apply CV methods to CNN architectures for 1D physiological signals. Because of the clarity of the experiments and the potential value to other researchers working on similar problems, I would recommend this paper for acceptance.	Although the manuscript's contribution is not significant, it still provides help in the selection of the attention mechanisms.	Although this paper provides a high-quality experimental guide on combining attention mechanisms with CNNs, novel designs and ideas are still lacking.
052	Attentional Generative Multimodal Network for Neonatal Postoperative Pain Estimation	The paper is clearly written, the problem is challenging and uses multiple modalities which are combine using autoencoders and attention layers. The architecture is interesting and the proposed approach reached the higuest reported accuracy in the literature.	"Lack of detailed information about the experiments: For example, authors do not describe how many data is used for the evaluation, how many pain/no pain cases there are. These information would help to understand the results exactly.
The results of the pain intensity estimation are seemed to be not good enough."	The paper proposes a novel multi-modal approach for the assessment of postoperative pain of neonates.  Instead of using early or late fusion techniques, a transformer-based attentional model is adopted to learn cross-modal features and generates final results.
053	Attention-enhanced Disentangled Representation Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Cardiac Segmentation	Novel channel-wise disentangled representation learning alongside extensive experimental results.	The topic of unsupervised domain adaptation and application to cross-modality segmentation is interesting. The weakness of this paper is that the experiment results are not solid.	Some modules seem to be unreasonable as I mentioned before.
054	Attentive Symmetric Autoencoder for Brain MRI Segmentation	Pre-tranining, new additions to the SSL method.	Considering the SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks, the clear motivation as well as the novelties in SPE and ARLoss, although the paper does not fully verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of its symmetric novelty, I think the paper is definitely above borderline and has the potential for acceptance. I would like to see the rebuttal response from the author and adjust my rating of the paper.	This paper is an interesting work, and the experiment is sufficient.
055	Autofocusing+: Noise-Resilient Motion Correction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging	The overall methods are interesting but this reviewer finds it is limited in novelty and comprehensiveness in experimental comparison.	"The authors proposed a neural network-based regularization term to improve the autofocusing method. More detail about the method is necessary to appreciate the contribution of this work. It is also important to understand how gradMC, ""a powerful optimization-based autofocusing method"", performs so poorly even with minimal motion."	The work is nicely and comprehensively depicted. Some methodological choices require further justification or investigation. Overall, the work describes an interesting new concept for addressing motion correction via autofocusing and deep learning.
056	AutoGAN-Synthesizer: Neural Architecture Search for Cross-Modality MRI Synthesis	"Both MRI synthesis using GAN and neural architecture search is not new.
This  combination seem new."	"I focus on experiemental results and methods.
Both of them are good."	Please check the detailed comments
057	AutoLaparo: A New Dataset of Integrated Multi-tasks for Image-guided Surgical Automation in Laparoscopic Hysterectomy	"The need for having more publicly available data set justifies my leaning towards accepting the paper. The several questions I outline above justify why it is a ""weak"" accept."	"This work provides a novel dataset featured by ""multi-task"". However, I expect more contents to expose the value of ""multi-task"". At least the authors should tell why the three tasks are coupled and how to practically benefit the surgical automation as a whole."	This paper presents a newly annotated dataset to the CAI field. The paper is well-written, and the description and details of the dataset are adequate. Several state-of-the-art approaches have been tested on the dataset as example uses. Overall, this paper is acceptable.
058	Automated Classification of General Movements in Infants Using Two-stream Spatiotemporal Fusion Network	The research motivation is clear and the paper is well-written. In general, the idea of proposed method is not new and contribution is limted. Also, the comparison and ablation study cannot fully show the effectiveness of proposed method.	"The automated General Movement Assessment is a difficult and yet clinically very relevant problem. The proposed approach is sound, relatively simple (in the good meaning of the word simple)  and the obtained results (even with the mentioned evaluation weaknesses) are improving the state of the art. 
At this point the merits slightly weight over the weaknesses."	Detailed ablation study and technical sound.
059	Automatic Detection of Steatosis in Ultrasound Images with Comparative Visual Labeling	My recommendation is based on the novelty of the task and its immense applicability in the field of medical imaging where generating good quality labels is often difficult and impedes machine learning training. The paper is very well written and can stimulate research in application of comparative visual labeling to medical diagnostic labeling tasks more.	Authors proposed an interesting approach to the labeling problem in fatty liver disease diagnosis. However, the usefulness of the proposed method was evaluated on relatively small datasets, which makes it difficult to assess the results. Moreover, the usefulness of the proposed method might be limited in practice for larger datasets due to the requirement to generate image pairs.	The use of the Ranknet for this application is innovative but I think the authors should provide more information on the type of inputs to this network, and the way they have evaluated their performance.
060	Automatic identification of segmentation errors for radiotherapy using geometric learning	"This paper attempts to train a solution for identifying segmentation errors.
Segmented parotid glands were perturbed with a tiny amount of random noise,
and then smoothed.  The network architecture is interesting, containing
both a CNN and a graph NN.  Graph elements are classified into 5 groups
related to their distance from the original segmentations.
Overall, this is a worthwhile paper in that it targets an important problem
and the approach is plausible.  The evaluation is fine, but without a proper user 
study we cannot really know if this will be useful."	The novelty and practical relevance of the introduced method outweighs the weaknesses of the work. The selection of the hyperparameter can be adapted to meaningful contouring errors and the evaluation extended to at least the human annotator in the used dataset (better to results of a current automated approach), in order to additionally get an evaluation on practical but not only synthetic contours. The partly incorrectly used terminology must be corrected, but overall, the methods innovative combination of CNNs and GNNs to consider both appearance and topology very efficiently for contouring error prediction justifies an accept.	The idea is relatively new.
061	Automatic Segmentation of Hip Osteophytes in DXA Scans using U-Nets	"The contribution is rather fair.
Direct use of the existing U-Net for the segmentation"	"Analysis of osteophytes (morphological and whatnot) in a rapidly emerging and important topic in scope of understanding the clinical picture of osteoarthritis progression. The study provides new evidence into the performance of automatic methods in the task, thereby complementing the sparse existing literature on the topic. The presented results have a good potential to facilitate a discussion on the best practices in annotation of osteophytes, longitudinal studies of their morphology, etc.

The study is conducted in a very principled way (excellent justification and description of the method components and the performed steps).

The overall novelty of this study in terms of methodolgy is rather limited."	This is a well-written paper with an interesting topic and results, but the methodology is not quite novel so I rate this paper as 'accept' rather than 'strong accept'.
062	Automating Blastocyst Formation and Quality Prediction in Time-Lapse Imaging with Adaptive Key Frame Selection	My overall impression of the paper is positive. The selection mechanism is clearly explained and could have potential application in other video analysis problems targeted by MICCAI. I need a rebuttal to form a stronger opinion.	Interesting method with promising results	"The proposed framework is novel. It addresses two issues in existing methods: input videos need to be manually annotated; redundant and irrelevant information in TLM videos can overwhelm the informative ones.
Extensive experiments on a large-size dataset were conducted, which includes comparison with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, to systematically evaluate the proposed method.
The manuscript writing is very good and clear."
063	Automation of clinical measurements on radiographs of children's hips	It is a well written paper with a strong evaluation, but only moderate novelty.	Although the clinical significance for the work is high, and the results of the proposed approach are compelling, this paper seems to be a direct application of known method (RFRV-CLM) limiting the innovation Furthermore, the authors do not describe any of the models' details, model training etc. The methods section focusses largely on experimental design.	While such a method could have a significant clinical impact, it is not fairly evaluated and discussed. Even if the model is not novel, more methodological details should be provided to the reader.
064	BabyNet: Residual Transformer Module for Birth Weight Prediction on Fetal Ultrasound Video	"An end-to-end birth weight estimation method is proposed and the proposed method is trained and validated with data acquired one day prior to delivery.
The experimental results of the proposed method is superior to the SOTA methods, but lacked innovation in the methodology."	BabyNet efficiently bridges CNNs and transformers for end-to-end estimations of fetal weights directly from US videos.	The paper addresses an interesting problem to estimate fetal birth weight from ultrasound videos. A novel architecture combining CNNs and vision transformer module is proposed. However, some points still remain unclear, e.g. interpretability of proposed models, overfitting on smaller datasets, and potential to use the method in clinical practice
065	Bayesian dense inverse searching algorithm for real-time stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery	The overall impression, presentation and completeness of the evaluation.	This paper presents a nice framework for stereo matching in surgical videos. The presented approach has adequate technical novelty that includes a novel Bayesian Dense Inverse Searching and a spatial Gausian Mixture Model. The validation is well conducted and results have shown their approach provides competitive performance to ELAS whilst retaining real-time processing speed.	The proposed methods are classic but the authors made a true experimental work.
066	Bayesian Pseudo Labels: Expectation Maximization for Robust and Efficient Semi-Supervised Segmentation	The idea of threshold optimization using variational inference for pseudo label based semi-supervised training is novel. This method can also be used to compute segmentation uncertainty.	This work proposed a new formulation of pseudo-labelling as an Expecation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clear statistical interpretation. And the authors further introduces a probabilistic extension of SegPL using variational inference, which learns a dynamic threshold during the training. The two formulations are novelty and may provide some new insights in the future.	This is the best paper in my batch and I really enjoyed reading it. The method is novel and well described, and the results are good. It will be a nice contribution to MICCAI.
067	Benchmarking the Robustness of Deep Neural Networks to Common Corruptions in Digital Pathology	Overall, I think this is still an interesting paper despite all the weaknesses listed.	This study study an significant problem when the model is deployed. The plenty of experiments is convincing.	While the general idea of the paper is good, I think that the methodology is not sufficient to support the claims. It is not surprising that corrupting images severely leads to a reduction in recognition, and that can't be attributed to model robustness issues. I think that model robustness amidst realistic pertubations is an issue, yet the methodology is insufficient to investigate this, as also reflected by the highly variant results in the paper.
068	BERTHop: An Effective Vision-and-Language Model for Chest X-ray Disease Diagnosis	The paper addresses an important research topic. The experiment presented in the paper is good but the description/contribution of proposed method is not well articulated.	The paper is well written and easy to follow, and a good evaluation of the architecture has been conducted.	The proposed architecture is simple and intuitive. The results are convincing and strongly support the arguments presented.
069	Bi-directional Encoding for Explicit Centerline Segmentation by Fully-Convolutional Networks	The novelty.	Overall, this paper proposed a novel and interesting approach for an existing problem. The intuition was justified and the experiments are good. I think this paper has met the standard of MICCAI.	It is appreciated that the authors compare their proposed method to multiple previously published methods, however, from my perspective, the experiments do not really assess the contribution proposed in the paper (e.g., the centerline encoding). Additionally, a description on how (whether) the reference methods were tuned and an analysis of failure cases are missing.
070	BiometryNet: Landmark-based Fetal Biometry Estimation from Standard Ultrasound Planes	Due to less convincing experimental results, the reviewer thinks this paper cannot meet the standard of MICCAI and rates this paper as weak accept.	In my opinion the validation is remarkable and allows for an objective assessment of the clinical viability of the methods, which in turn seems to be very high.	Overall, this paper is good. It proposes a novel dynamic orientation determination to generalize the landmark class reassignment to multiple scenarios. It evaluated the proposed method on a large dataset. The results seem sound and promising.
071	BMD-GAN: Bone mineral density estimation using x-ray image decomposition into projections of bone-segmented quantitative computed tomography using hierarchical learning	"The proposed method is interesting
The paper is not well written
The paper deserves acceptation if slightly improved for the readers"	Excellent paper, a useful goal, novel implimentation, improvement over SOTA, consideration of clinical need.	The paper is well presented with a novel formulation, interesting application, and comprehensive results.
072	Boundary-Enhanced Self-Supervised Learning for Brain Structure Segmentation	"The motivation is clear and intuitive.

The proposed method sounds reasonable to me.

The experimental results are satisfactory."	The idea of regressing distance maps defined by supervoxels is somewhat interesting. However, considering the major weaknesses mentioned in Q5, I rate it weak reject.	The limited technical contribution and performance are the main weaknesses of the paper. The method should be further refined to enhance boundary segmentation and more solid results should be provided.
073	BoxPolyp: Boost Generalized Polyp Segmentation using Extra Coarse Bounding Box Annotations	The study addresses a problem arising from new publicly available datasets, and is therefore new and timely. It focuses on a problem rooted on clinical translatability (rather than improving results on curated data) which is of great importance. The proposed modules are innovative, particularly the FFS methodology to generate pixel-level labels handling uncertain pixels.	The paper is well-written and organized, but some method details should be added.	The method shows some benefit especially in using large detection video dataset. However, the arguments on doing this are slim. Alongside, the generalisability assessment is lacking. I think rationale behind developing a segmentation model with the detection labels doesn't fit right because you could just make a detection method which is already of interest in clinical practice, why leverage for segmentation?
074	Brain-Aware Replacements for Supervised Contrastive Learning in Detection of Alzheimer's Disease	The paper is well organized and the objectives clear. It has sufficient technical novelty for MICCAI and the presented method is thoroughly evaluated.	The limited applicability of the introduced augmentations and the weaknesses in the evaluation push toward not accepting the paper. Minor improvements might lead to upvoting the paper.	"I appreciate that they focus on the problems of ""Cutmix"" in the medical image field. Their method produces a great variety of realistic-looking synthetic MRIs with higher local variability."
075	Breaking with Fixed Set Pathology Recognition through Report-Guided Contrastive Training	The paper is well structured, with careful and thorough experimental design with the claims being made supported by the results. There are a few minor points that need addressing (see weaknesses). However, overall the paper is in good shape.	The authors present an elaborated framework for multimodal training that involves both image and text, obtaining text information from radiology reports both locally and globally. This framework is novel and very valuable for the community, along with the introduction of self-supervised learning and a more wide range of diseases that do not require explicit annotation.	"The novelty of the proposed framework is limited. In my opinion, introducing large pre-trained models to solve a downstream task cannot bring new insights to the community. It's very important to explain why the proposed approaches can solve the claimed problems.

It's not clear why the proposed approach can improve the fluency, adequacy, and fidelity of novel object captions.

Some important analyses should be perfomed to prove the contributions and claims of paper."
076	Building Brains: Subvolume Recombination for Data Augmentation in Large Vessel Occlusion Detection	While the methods is interesting, the methods description is hard to follow and could be improved	The paper is well written (despite some grammar errors) but the innovation might not be high. Also the specific application on large vessel occlusion classification limits its reader group/impact.	The paper is well presented and the proposed method is clear and effective. Although the motivation is not properly explained, it might be guessed. For example, the method could be used for triage. I would have liked to see more significant efforts in terms of reproducibility.
077	CACTUSS: Common Anatomical CT-US Space for US examinations	I recommend an accept because the authors describe a clear methodology and novel pipeline. The one major weakness is that there is no AAA patient data, and therefore it remains to be seen if this technique would work for AAA diagnosis for the proposed clinica	The data used is not quite suitable for applications like AAA diagnosis.  This however is a good feasibility on a cross-modality application.	The major factors were the use of an intermediate space generated from US simulation and linked with real US images through a CUT algorithm that is a concept novel to this reviewer and appears to perform at a clinically acceptable level. Further validation in a larger, diverse patient cohort is needed.
078	Calibrating Label Distribution for Class-Imbalanced Barely-Supervised Knee Segmentation	"Significant improvement in performance
Novel approaches within an existing framework to improve semi-supervised learning
An important topic with potential for broader application however this could be better explained
Experiments could be more thorough
Discussion of the importance of the result could be better
not very much consideration of clinical translation"	Some effectiveness for a medical application/problem.	Most of the paper is neatly written with a good problem definition and novel methodological solution. Only conclusion needs rework.
079	Calibration of Medical Imaging Classification Systems with Weight Scaling	The paper tackles a very important problem in deep learning, network calibration. A novel calibration procedure is proposed and the fair evaluation shows a clear improvement with respect existing calibration procedures.	Well done on trying the approach, interesting and a nice read, my only concern is that perhaps I see it closely related to another paper (as mentioned above), but the methodology is interesting and perhaps even though similar, the findings are interesting. Perhaps I am a little sckeptical re the final results, but perhaps more clarity on the method re points raised would be good to clear up.	Two main problems of the paper is the concise math notation and the lack of experimental results using other metrics.
080	Camera Adaptation for Fundus-Image-Based CVD Risk Estimation	The main idea of this work and the construction of the dataset are of great importance. The propose scheme considers the camera adaption problem in a new view.	In my opinion, the experiment setting in this paper is generally reasonable. However, the investigation of related resarch is not enough. The experiment results is not convincing and do not compare with state of the art methods.	I think this paper is of great significance for clinical application, and the method is feasible and the experimental results are promising.
081	Capturing Shape Information with Multi-Scale Topological Loss Terms for 3D Reconstruction	This contribution could be deemed innovative, and incorporating topological/shape information into reconstruction appears valuable, but would need to do a more exhaustive comparison and discuss implementation/computation further.	This paper makes a valuable technical contribution - a differentiable topological loss function - that could enable significant further work in this area if the descriptions of certain aspects of the process are clarified to support reproducibility of the work. Although other attempts have been made to do this in the past, this is the most convincing I have seen.	The proposed method is novel with solid mathematical analysis. The submission is generally well-written and clear to follow. The main weakness is the lack of experimental verification on the robustness of L_T with different weights, which is of practical value. Thus I recommend a weak acceptance before rebuttal.
082	Carbon Footprint of Selecting and Training Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Analysis	The paper makes a strong point that should be of interest to the whole MICCAI community and beyond.	The paper is very original and relevant for the community. It is very well written and structured. Results are reported clearly. I am glad that teams within the community are looking into this.	The contributions of the paper are too limited.  In addition, the overall technical quality of this paper is poor.
083	CaRTS: Causality-driven Robot Tool Segmentation from Vision and Kinematics Data	I think the idea is fairly creative but I don't see a clear path to improving the state of the art in segmentation (which this paper is addressing) using this approach.	This paper presents a novel and flexible framework that questions the standard approach to robot tool segmentation. Both the novelty and the adequate experimental validation outweigh the lack of justification and discussion around some methodological choices. Therefore, I incline towards acceptance.	The proposed framework is very interesting as it defines and employs multiple sources of information that are commonly available in real settings (kinematics and vision). Upcoming works should follow this trend and employ all information available to generate algorithms that are more robust and reliable, in 'any' scenario.
084	CASHformer: Cognition Aware SHape Transformer for Longitudinal Analysis	Overall, the paper has good quality, however, the comparison and ablation is not sufficient.	Overall the paper is well written, and the experiments are good and solid.	The overall clarity, medical significance and clinical anchor are appreciable. The methodological contributions and outperforming results are clear, as well as a good generalization potential to approaches for the processing of longitudinal data. Nevertheless, the considerable overlap with ref [24] is quite remarkable and remains problematic to me.
085	Censor-aware Semi-supervised Learning for Survival Time Prediction from Medical Images	This is a very well written paper with some strong results in public datasets. It can improve by including more details about the data.	The paper is quite strong. The presented idea is straight forward and easy to combine with other approaches. A real problem is addressed and the solution is well evaluated. However, while the paper is solid research, I've missed the surprising element or the additional effort to make it an outstanding paper.	Overall, I think this is an interesting paper. The proposed method leverage censored data for survival prediction and show improved results. Please be able to address my concerns.
086	CephalFormer: Incorporating Global Structure Constraint into Visual Features for General Cephalometric Landmark Detection	"Considering the impressive performance and the careful network design, I tend to accept the submission in pre-rebuttal. However, some details need to be elaborated. The authors claim that they are the first to explicitly model the dependencies between all visual features and anatomical landmarks. But the landmark embedding is not well defined and evaluated, i.e., what is the definition? How is it calculated? Moreover, What is the insight? How does it affect the performance? (without the landmark embedding) Besides, the way to model global structure constraints is very similar to the [p1p2]. Considering the unclear definition and lacking evaluation of landmark embedding, it is doubtful that the current representation supports such a strong statement. The final score is depended on the response.
[p1] Structure-aware long short-term memory network for 3d cephalometric landmark detection (TMI 2022).
[p2] Structured landmark detection via topology-adapting deep graph
learning (ECCV 2022)."	The manuscript presented a new neural network based method for anatomical landmark detection. But its technique is not sound. More explanation and description are required for further improvement.	This paper has quite strong innovations and also quite easy for readers to follow. A very nice paper to be accepted.
087	Cerebral Microbleeds Detection Using a 3D Feature Fused Region Proposal Network with Hard Sample Prototype Learning	This paper includes several innovations as seen in the strength, and the proposed method can be useful for research in different topics. A few weaknesses need to be addressed.	"*	A discussion or at least mentioning of the limitations, possible improvements and future work is missing entirely.
*	Furthermore, a prominent issue is that the results cannot be directly compared to the state-of-the-art methods hence the significance of them is somewhat unclear"	The aim of the paper is interesting. However, the experimental evaluation is limited and specific to a single dataset.
088	CFDA: Collaborative Feature Disentanglement and Augmentation for Pulmonary Airway Tree Modeling of COVID-19 CTs	Novel method; experiments on publicly available data; thorough comparison with existing solution to the problem	The motivation of this work and the technique about the disentangle are the two major factors make me give the very positive evaluation on this work. However, the unclear description related to the augmentation and training procedure slightly lower the evaluation.	Interesting idea and good technical quality.
089	Characterization of brain activity patterns across states of consciousness based on variational auto-encoders	A solid paper but missing some quantitative results	The novelty of this paper focuses on the description of the latent space. However, more detailed information about the methods and experiments are required.	The contributions are unclear.
090	CheXRelNet: An Anatomy-Aware Model for Tracking Longitudinal Relationships between Chest X-Rays	Technical novelty, reproducibility, and results achieved.	The monitoring topic and global-local consideration are interesting for CXR. But, there exists some weakness in the method design and experiment results.	nice study.
091	ChrSNet: Chromosome Straightening using Self-attention Guided Networks	"Much of the paper describes architectures that were shown by the experiments to be of little value, and the lack of added value of certain architectures is not discussed. While negative findings are useful to report, the paper should be shaped accordingly. 
There were quite a few typos."	"Novelty of the proposal, and novelty of the task.
Extremely well conducted experimental evaluation."	The paper is good. I am willing to change from 6 to 7 or 8, if the AC can verify on the code release and reproducibility.
092	CIRDataset: A large-scale Dataset for Clinically-Interpretable lung nodule Radiomics and malignancy prediction	I like the idea, but I'm not entirely sure (1) if there is enough novelty and (2) if the evaluation supports the author's claims.	Not an easy decision, but in the end I did not find sufficient evidence for the impact of the new approach, as performance was a mixed bag overall.	The method is simple and well designed. The results are difficult to assess without comparison with state of the art methods.
093	Class Impression for Data-free Incremental Learning	"The proposed class impression is an interesting approach that mitigates catastrophic forgetting problems in incremental learning. The experiment demonstrates that the class impression outperforms existing schemes. However, the clinical effectiveness of the experiment is not sufficiently demonstrated
 "	The decision are mainly  made according to the novelty of the proposed framework and the organization of this paper.	It is challenging to deploy class-incremental learning for medical image analysis. The proposed approach is novel. To the best of my knowledge there are no existing data- free rehearsal-based class incremental learning work on deep neural networks specifically designed for medical image analysis.
094	Classification-aided High-quality PET Image Synthesis via Bidirectional Contrastive GAN with Shared Information Maximization	The method is ok.	Novel idea and strong evaluation.	"Originality: Generative adversarial network and contrastive learning have been investigated in PET image synthesis. However, this paper combines them for PET analysis tasks. Novelty is limited.
Quality: The paper introduces the model and provides few experimental evaluation. Especially, another contribution claimed by the authors is the loss function. However, the authors did not provide complete experimental results to analyze the impacts of each components of the loss function.
Clarity: The paper is well-structured and mainly well-written.
Significance: The ideas used here could be utilized in different medical image analysis tasks. The paper studies how to generate high-quality standard-dose PET synthesis from low-dose PET images with a bi-directional contrastive generative adversarial network (BiC-GAN)."
095	Clinical-realistic Annotation for Histopathology Images with Probabilistic Semi-supervision: A Worst-case Study	"Original approach
Good results
Interesting topic"	The method introduced an interesting annotation strategy for histopathology images, which is proved effective on Camelyon16 compared with a few self-supervised and weakly-supervised methods.	"The well-motivated idea.
The novel probabilistic ratio-based weak supervision training pipeline. However, an explanation for my Major concern (2) is needed for my final rating."
096	CLTS-GAN: Color-Lighting-Texture-Specular Reflection Augmentation for Colonoscopy	"a clear clinical need is identified
an interesting method for transferring lighting and texture style separately from real to synthetic images
good results
manuscript is mostly well written but some parts could be more clear."	The definition of the model is at times very confusing between figure, text and equations	The authors present and interesting and flexible approach for the manipulation of OC images. The paper is well written, but hard to follow (also due to the complexity of the presented approach). A more structured way of presenting the use cases of the proposed framework would improve the paper.
097	Collaborative Quantization Embeddings for Intra-Subject Prostate MR Image Registration	This is a good submission with clear organization, and enough technical contributions. If the authors solve my major concern above, I will keep my rating.	The paper is well-written. The approach is well-motivated, well-described, and innovative. The evaluation includes an ablation of method components and a favorable comparison against reference methods. For me, this paper checks all  the boxes.	The recommendation is based on the format violations and the main weaknesses listed above.
098	Combining mixed-format labels for AI-based pathology detection pipeline in a large-scale knee MRI study	No statistical testing, lack of comparison to baseline methods, difficulty to reproduce.	"Method for grading knee lesions from multi-view multi-protocol MRI.

Strong clinically-relevant evaluation of the proposed method.

Interesting results showing the value of (I) combining positional and categorical annotations, (II) multi-institutional data for model robustness.

Limited methodological novelty of the work (not end-to-end, not multi-label).

Limited analysis w.r.t prior art, both methodological (deep learning) and clinical (lesions in knee MRI).

Excellent quality paper, with very high reproducibility score."	Interesting paper that tests a novel strategy to use pixel level labels to improve locational accuracy of text labels. The hope is such models can reduce need for time and labor intensive pixel level annotations while building ML models. The authors do a good job of providing statistical metrics on various ablation methods but unfortunately do not any real world stats such reduced annotation time without reduction in model performance.
099	Combining multiple atlases to estimate data-driven mappings between functional connectomes using optimal transport	The novelty of the proposed algorithm.	The positives outweigh the negatives. An interesting method with thorough evaluation and something different to complement all the CNN papers at MICCAI.	Use of multiple source atlases to better generalise the mapping of target atlas is interesting and the results show promise in the proposed method. Also, the experiments are done thoroughly along with the parameter sensitivity test.
100	Computer-aided Tuberculosis Diagnosis with Attribute Reasoning Assistance	The whole proposed attribute-guided method is novel for TB detection, but the components need more innovative modification for medical image recognition. And the insufficient experiments can not provide evidence for the effective of some operation.	"1.The dataset proposed combines the former dataset TBX11K. It offers a playground for attribute-assisted X-ray diagnosis for TB.

The model proposed inherits two branches thought without much novelty.
The experiment is not sufficient."	Overall, the paper presents a compelling limitation of previous work and presents a dataset and an approach to overcome it. However, the evaluation and description of both the method and the dataset is quite limited.
101	Conditional Generative Data Augmentation for Clinical Audio Datasets	The topic is interesting. The approach is easy to follow and will encourage good debate in the conference.	Weak novelty of proposed method, as well as the insufficient experimental results	"Novelty of the approach
The dataset was small and not well justified
The results are promising but could have been better described"
102	Conditional VAEs for confound removal and normative modelling of neurodegenerative diseases	Clear and simple paper with promising results.	For above reasons, the paper holds little technical and analytical contributions.	Overal, paper is a good one. But, in rebuttal I want to see a clear method part. If we have a clear VAE model in the paper, we need also relevant theory from literature too.
103	Consistency-based Semi-supervised Evidential Active Learning for Diagnostic Radiograph Classification	The rating is based on the fact that a new active learning framework is presented in this paper for radiological image classification, which achieves comparable (or better) performance to the state of the art.	The proposed method is novel, and the authors obtain good results on an X-ray dataset. However, with limited experiments, it is difficult to justify a higher rating.	The approach is quite interesting and seems to be useful. Although there are some shortcomings in reporting the results.
104	Consistency-preserving Visual Question Answering in Medical Imaging	Its a novel approach for a very specific medical problem.	The authors demonstrate improvements on model consistency as well as model accuracy in diabetic macular edema staging. The novelty of the proposed method, however, is not clear.	Lack of novelty and generalizibility of method is unproven. Further, no recent SOTA methods are used to compare.
105	Context-Aware Transformers For Spinal Cancer Detection and Radiological Grading	The novelty of this paper is the design of SCT and the use of information from free-text radiological reports as supervision, both of which are interesting. The main problem is the baseline models, which might be unfair when compared with the proposed approach.	The paper is well written and exposes well the proposed approach. The topic could be of interest to the general public as it could raise discussion of the interest of transformers as a promising tool. There might be a few minor improvements that could be done before moving forward (see detailed comments.	Reasonable and novel method with comprehensive experiments.
106	Context-aware Voxel-wise Contrastive Learning for Label Efficient Multi-organ Segmentation	Consider that the paper's methodology contribution is relative minor, quite a few major concerns for the experimental evaluation and the clarity of this work is relative low, I recommend weak reject.	"1) The motivation to introduce contrastive learning is weak. It's always not necesary to sample two overlapping patches for training in organ segmentation.
2) The innovation is not sufficient. Constrastive learning has been shown to be useful for feature representation learning. The work is an incremental work."	The use of contrastive learning in partially labeled segmentation problem and the improvement of the performance.
107	ConTrans: Improving Transformer with Convolutional Attention for Medical Image Segmentation	Refer to weakness and strength section.	Overall, this manuscript have some merits and ideas. However, the introduced attention-based module is not novel enough, which could not become the major contribution. I could not recommend the acceptance of this manuscript at such top-ranking performance.	While the proposed model achieve SOTA on various dataset, whether the improvement is due to proposed design or simply using a larger encoder is unclear; on the other hand, most of the contribution is derivative and based on prior work with few modifications and weak motivation.
108	ContraReg: Contrastive Learning of Multi-modality Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration	The authors present a novel method with promise results.	The clarity of the paper and the insufficient comparisons with other methods.	The authors present a novel approach to multimodal image registration using deep learning. Excellent concise, theoretically sound paper with clear motivation, presentation of related work, good evaluation and comparison with the state of the art.
109	Contrast-free Liver Tumor Detection using Ternary Knowledge Transferred Teacher-student Deep Reinforcement Learning	"Author was able to justify the method used with good explanation in methodology and structured analysis.
Ternary knowledge add another feature F where the student get to know why the action need to be done."	The topci of this paper is interesting. The paper is technialy sound with well presentation.	Although some details are missing, the paper study an important problem and the proposed method show improvement than previous baselines. This work will interest more researchers and clinical doctors if the datasets and source codes will be availabel.
110	Contrastive Functional Connectivity Graph Learning for Population-based fMRI Classification	Clarity of the methods and missing details of comparisons with state-of-the art methods	The improvement is good and the method is rather straightforward.	I think overall the idea is novel and their experimental evaluation is strong in terms of setting and results.
111	Contrastive learning for echocardiographic view integration	The idea, its explanation, and execution of experiments are complete and close to perfect. The paper would add value to the community.	The idea is interesting and the paper is well-written. However, the experimental drawbacks  and the technical implementation remains problematic.	The novelty of the paper is enough to be accepted and the ablation study evaluation provides convincing results that show that the proposed architecture and loss does indeed improve the model performance.
112	Contrastive Masked Transformers for Forecasting Renal Transplant Function	According to my knowledge, this study is among the first that propose a novel, robust, and clinically relevant framework for forecasting serum creatinine directly from imaging data.	Overall, the paper is intersted but have a lot of modifications and some experiments	The methods and results are sufficient. However, it needs more discussions
113	Contrastive Re-localization and History Distillation in Federated CMR Segmentation	The manuscript attacks a legitimate problem in federated learning and has introduced innovative ideas. Results demonstrate superior performance compared with established approaches. The major flaw is the description of the method which could be addressed in a proper rebuttal.	Representation bias is quite a huge problem in FL and the method aims to reduce the bias at the same time ensuring the optimisation is continuous and not affected by the heterogeneity in the dataset characteristics. The method is novel and handles multiple functions simultaneously and is interesting to see in this specific application. The comparative analysis is extensive on multiple datasets. The work is clearly presented with good figures.	The quality of writing, and the way of presenting the methods are unsatisfacotry. The experiments that support the claimed contributions are not described clearly and convincingly.
114	Contrastive Transformer-based Multiple Instance Learning for Weakly Supervised Polyp Frame Detection	The paper is well written, except some places are not perfectly organized which may be caused limited space.	This paper proposes a framework to identify abnormalities (frames that include polyps) from colonoscopy video snippets. The authors collected a dataset from publicly available data. This data should be approved by experts before publication, and further experiments are required to validate this method against the one which deployed a similar approach.	"This paper is more of an application paper in my eyes. Although the building blocks of the system come from the literature, the proposed system does have a great performance. It can be a novel application paper from this aspect. This is the reason I vote ""Weak accept"" for the paper."
115	Coronary R-CNN: Vessel-wise Method for Coronary Artery Lesion Detection and Analysis in Coronary CT Angiography	I think the paper is well written, but it lacks any new technique or ideas. The results are comparable to the previous methods and I do not see any statistically significant difference in the accuracy values.	The method may not be innovative enough. The first stage of the method seems to be a simple application of Faster RCNN to the lesion detection problem without modifications for medical images or lesion detection target. More details and explanation need to be added.	This paper tackles detection of plaque-type and stenosis degree simultaneously by inputting the whole curved planar reformation (CPR) volume along the coronary artery centerline instead of slices. A commonly used Faster R-CNN and a  novel two binary digits code loss are applied. The method is verified on a private CCTA dataset and the results demonstrated the efficacy of the approach.
116	CorticalFlow++: Boosting Cortical Surface Reconstruction Accuracy, Regularity, and Interoperability	I would like to hear from the authors about my questions. I have concerns on the feasibility of the proposed method.	The paper is well written and the proposed method is easy to follow.	See above.
117	CRISP - Reliable Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Segmentation	The method presented is novel and the results clearly show that the method is able to provide uncertainty estimates beyon edges. I believe the paper is promising and insightsfull for future research.	While the experimental evidence is on par with existing uncertainty estimation, the proposed method has major flaws, as mentioned in point 2 in weakness. Further, it is unclear how the latent space k-nearest ensemble is different from a mask-level ensemble. Hence I recommend rejection.	I found the idea quite interesting and I am quite lean to suggest accept for the paper. However, lack of comparison and discussion of the relevant literature is a major weakness which prevent me to give a higher score. If the authors can justify why there is no comparison and discussion about the methods I mention, then I would be happy to increase my score.
118	CS2: A Controllable and Simultaneous Synthesizer of Images and Annotations with Minimal Human Intervention	This paper studies important problem, presents technically sound approach, and reports promising results. These are major factors lead to the positive rate.	Certain aspects of the approach were unclear to me, however, the main idea is quite innovative. I hope the authors can address some of the technical questions (please see above) during the rebuttal period.	"Experiments and analysis don't back the motivation of the paper:
Synthetic image generation is beneficial for rare disease that do not have large number of human annotation readily available, or some pathologies that require multi-modal images to conduct proper analysis and therefore are hard to be annotated even by human experts. Lung segmentation and GGO segmentation are not."
119	Curvature-enhanced Implicit Function Network for High-quality Tooth Model Generation from CBCT Images	Obtains state of the art results, but has some clarity issues and misses many details about training. Also, experiments could be more convincing using cross-validation.	The work proposes a novel method for 3D tooth model construction. The ideas of using multi-modal data and using IFN with curvature encoding look reasonable and the experimental results show their effectiveness. However, there are certain reproducibility issues, and more detailed explanations would help readers.	application and innovation
120	DA-Net: Dual Branch Transformer and Adaptive Strip Upsampling for Retinal Vessels Segmentation	The authors propose a novel architecture with transformers. Their method takes into account global and local information by processing regions and the whole image. Also the approach is supplemented with an additional  methodological novelty that seems to be tailored to the vessel segmentation problem (ASUB block).	The paper presents a novel way of combining image and patch level segmentation, which is shown to outperform previous methods. Also the use of adaptive strip upsampling suits well for segmentation of elongated structures. However, there is not sufficient justification given to appreciate if dual branches outperform single branch.	The paper is well writen and the proposed method is novel. Furthermore, the code will be released.
121	D'ARTAGNAN: Counterfactual Video Generation	I think the author could have compared with strong baseline by using methods proposed on general images and videos.	Work seems interesting with a nice application.	The proposed model looks novel, and the experimental results look promising. However, the description of the model is not clear, and the proposed model is not compared with other models in the experiments. The paper might need major revision before it is published.
122	Data-Driven Deep Supervision for Skin Lesion Classification	The presented problem is important especially in explainable AI sense. Even if the authors approach has some points that requires further explanation and evaluation, the reviewer thinks that the contribution is valuable.	I think the method is interesting and it shows some improvement, but I am worried that the performance will depend heavily on the size of the objects (compared to standard methods) and the method will not generalize well to cases where the sizes of the objects are variable, or if there are multiple objects of different sizes, etc.	The whole framework is complete and the experiments are extensive. The accurately localized lesions are helpful for assisting clinical diagnosis.
123	Data-driven Multi-Modal Partial Medical Image Preregistration by Template Space Patch Mapping	The paper lacks methodological novelty. While the results improve on prior work, I am unsure about how the training was done, and seem convinced the model is overfit to the dataset. This would render the model unusable in practice.	This is a well written paper with good experimental setup and validation of a novel  registration initialization method based on deep learning. The authors provide a set of cross validation experiments to compare their proposed initialization strategy to conventional initializations and then demonstrate the effect these have on rigid registration in both standard (non-deep learning) and deep learning registration.	"The paper provides a very interesting alternative initialization for multimodal registration methods, outperforming competing methods in a range of categories.
I think it's a good contribution to the field.
I can't find major faults on the method or the paper itself, which is quite solid"
124	DDPNet: A novel dual-domain parallel network for low-dose CT reconstruction	Good novelty, poor clarity, poor rigorousness.	The novelty is limited as the interactive dual domain has been investigated in literature; the authors did not cite and compare them. The detailed network architecture and hyperparameters were not provided. Most importantly, the results have HU shift compared to ground-truth one, which limits its clinical value.	The performance of DDPNet is impressive since it is hard to improve PSNR from 44.90 to 45.29.
125	Decoding Task Sub-type States with Group Deep Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network	This manuscript proposed a novel method to identify brain state. It shows great improvement over current SOTA methods. However, it still need to be carefully revised to make the method to be more clear. Therefore, I think this manuscript should be weakly accepted.	This paper proposes a novel group-wise brain function state classification network. Experiments demonstrate the excellent performance over current methods. It is important to this field.	In the manuscript, the authors proposed a novel group-wise Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network for analysis of the brain function sub-type states. It is important to this field.
126	Decoupling Predictions in Distributed Learning for Multi-Center Left Atrial MRI Segmentation	The paper is highly interesting. It presents a novel solution to a very relevant problem in federated learning, which could become the state of the art for this task.	The work is interesting and results are good. The novelty of the method and the reliability of the results need to be further clarified.	
127	Deep filter bank regression for super-resolution of anisotropic MR brain images	"The paper is overall well written, an interesting take of SR using DSP methods (albeit not pure DSP since detail coefficients ""d"" are predicted using pix2pix). Authors have shown the method is comparable with SMORE, a SOTA method."	Methodological novelty with a solid validation, and a well written paper to boot.	The writing is not clear, and the experiment is inadequate, so I do not recommend acceptance.
128	Deep Geometric Supervision Improves Spatial Generalization in Orthopedic Surgery Planning	This is an intersting paper with novel formulation and satisfactory results. However, the method description should be explained better and so I rated the paper as 'accept'.	Well written (although sometimes a little convoluted). Novel methodology with strong evidence of improving planning accuracy.	This study is an important step towards the automized planning, which is robust to various clinical environments. The writing could be improved for better context and clarity.
129	Deep is a Luxury We Don't Have	The paper proposes an efficient transformer model to process the high resolution mammograms. The results suggest improvements over previous approaches.	Unlike the transformer limited by the GPU memory, the Performer can be deployed in the shadow layer due to the full-rank computing strategy. Taking advantage of Performer, this work validates the feasibility of Performer in analyzing high-resolution mammography. Despite of the improved performance, this work lacks the dedicated comparison between the deep and shallow network, which is emphasized on the title.	The experimental part of this paper is insufficient to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of experimental setup, baselines, and datasets. In addition, the novelty of this paper still needs to be improved.
130	Deep Laparoscopic Stereo Matching with Transformers	The paper is very well written. It has some novelty in the methods, and the authors provide adequate justification for the proposed architectural changes. The superiority of the method is shown both quantitatively and qualitatively using publicly available datasets. Moreover, the performance of the method is compared to the state-of-the-art demonstrating its competitiveness. The application novelty combined with thorough validation makes this paper acceptable for presentation in MICCAI 2022.	Very limited novelty, not convicing claims, and not thorough and validate experiment results.	As aforementioned, extensive experiments on various aspects were performed, which is very helpful for the readers. Also, the results seem promising.
131	Deep Learning based Modality-Independent Intracranial Aneurysm Detection	The missing comparison to other methods is the major weakness.	The paper presents an interesting approach and achieves very good results but the impact of the vessel extraction on the detection accuracy and the generalizability of the approach with respect to imaging parameters and therefore, clinical routine remain unclear.	The method presented shows good performance, along with robust validation strategy that shows the model can generalize to some degree to different imaging modalities. The problem of intracranial aneurysm detection is fairly important, and it is great that the authors are aware of the common pitfalls regarding generalizability of the machine learning models and attempting to rectify this.
132	Deep Learning-based Facial Appearance Simulation Driven by Surgically Planned Craniomaxillofacial Bony Movement	"good paper, a useful goal, novel implimentation
some issues related to clarity, details and discussion of the findings"	The manuscript was well prepared and written, the motivation and contribution are clear. The constructed dataset is reasonable. The demonstration of the method is good. And the author presented the good results and high efficiency of the proposed method. This work may have a potential application in orthognathic surgery.	The paper proposes a novel and interesting methodology to address a well-known and open issue in surgery. The paper is clear, well-organized and detailed. The conducted evaluation is satisfactory and thorough. Obtained results are strong and convincing.
133	Deep learning-based Head and Neck Radiotherapy Planning Dose Prediction via Beam-wise Dose Decomposition	I believe the core idea of this work - decomposing the dose prediction utilizing beam path masks - is an interesting concept that has been well implemented via the proposed method. However, I fail to see the rationale behind the value-based DVH loss, the other main contributions claimed by the authors. Additionally, I have concerns regarding the incomplete experiments and the lack of discussion how this work fits into the full clinical radiotherapy pipeline.	"This study propose a novel dose estimation method and showed experimental results using a grand challenge dataset. The reviewer found that this study is interesting. However, this paper has a room for improvement.
Major concerns:

No statistical analysis has been made for evaluation, and then it is unclear that the result can be confirmed. The authors should show the variance of the resultant scores. In addition, statistically significant difference should be discussed.
Each radiotherapy beam might have a machine-specific dose distribution. However, it does not assume it. Please discuss the validity for the proposed method that does not assume a machine-specific dose distribution.
Improvement from the existing studies seems to be small.

Minor comments:

Table 2 appears earlier than Table 1. Table 2 should be placed later in the paper."	This paper proposes a global-to-beam network to conduct the dose prediction task. Meanwhile, there are some concerns on unclear technical/network description, insufficient comparison and evaluation, esp. to justify that it is really useful and practical in the clinical studies.
134	Deep Motion Network for Freehand 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction	"I really enjoyed reading your research report. It is a combination of Sensors (IMU) and deep learning field which is a promising solution for 3D reconstruction of 2D images. I am not a fan of estimating 6DOF using Machine Learning and Statistical methods. Authors exactly answer this issue especially when I see they used EM sensor for comparison section. 
Experimental results and also video in supplement data clearly show the effort of authors for improvement of 3D reconstruction problem."	It is very sound, the method is nice and the results are very impressive. Furthermore, relevance for clinical use is high.	"This paper deals with a niche but active area of research. 
Using the acceleration from an IMU had never been proven to be useful so far, so this paper does contribute to the state of the art. 
As I mentioned in the other subsections, the paper would benefit from a polishing and a rewriting of some parts, but overall I recommend acceptance."
135	Deep Multimodal Guidance for Medical Image Classification	the model performance and the methodological novelty	The paper includes both technical novelty and clinical relevance. Together with the careful preparation of the paper and the good reproducibility, I propose to accept this contribution.	The main reasons for the strong accept are the compelling clinical application, seemingly very clear and straightforward approach, and rigorous multi-faceted evaluation.  The question about novelty compared to the prior student-teacher methods is the only factor pulling it down in my view.
136	Deep Regression with Spatial-Frequency Feature Coupling and Image Synthesis for Robot-Assisted Endomicroscopy	"This paper describes the authors approach for feedback control of a probe-based
confocal imaging system.  The system is image-based, whereby the distance
from probe to sample is optimized by examining the probe output.  The network
architecture is interesting, using both spatial and frequency domain learning,
and a loss that function that encodes both the (supervised) optimal distance value
and image sharpness.  Overall it seems to be a worthwhile paper that solves
an important problem.  Evaluation against manually labeled distances shows good
performance compared with other architectures."	"The organization and clarity are good.
The contribution is clear and solid.
The Result is compatible while not clear to visualize."	The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The application is new and the method consisting of SFFC-Net and FT seems novel. The experiment results also looks promising.
137	Deep Reinforcement Learning for Detection of Inner Ear Abnormal Anatomy in Computed Tomography	"The proposal, approach and validation are good.
The method's clarity can be improved."	This is interesting work albeit preliminary. This reviewer feels the authors should have focussed on one of the approaches and developed a more complete description and  evaluation than reporting on two different approaches incompletely. In addition, the narrative presentation needs some revision as the long dense sentences sometimes make it difficult to understand what the authors intend to convey.	The paper has a clear clinical motivation and brings some new ideas to detect the inner ear abnormality.
138	Deep Reinforcement Learning for Small Bowel Path Tracking using Different Types of Annotations	There are no major errors in the approach - paper appears to be interesting for the community	The major weakness of the paper is in justifying the results using statistical tests, if that is addressed along with some other comments made above, I think this paper would be more complete.	It is a nice DRL paper in the application of path tracking . The authors adapted some related algorithms to make the DRL work well.
139	Deep treatment response assessment and prediction of colorectal cancer liver metastases	"Treatment response prediction is an important step to patient selection for treatment planning as well as drug trials. Promising results in this direction.
Results are on a small dataset which is typical in medical image problems
3D images are used as input as compared to 2D thus incorporating more local and global info."	The paper is clinically relevant as well as technically novel.	The results presented in the paper were not fully validated because 1) the data size is limited and no cross validation was used; 2) there might be label leakage for the treatment response assessment model if multiple CT pairs were acquired for one patient.
140	DeepCRC: Colorectum and Colorectal Cancer Segmentation in CT Scans via Deep Colorectal Coordinate Transform	The paper presents a simple and novel approach to solve the task at hand. The experimentation validates all the design choices and the results prove the improvement obtained by the surrogate task intorduced.	Paper has potential but for MICCAI standards it needs evaluation on a wider or alternative dataset, or release of the code to allow reproducibilty and independent testing on other datasets.	"The motivation of the paper is solid and clear;
The task of the paper is interesting and important;
The solution of the algorithm is novel;
The experimental results to some extent validate the effectiveness of the algorithm."
141	Deep-learning Based T1 and T2 Quantification from Undersampled Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting Data to Track Tracer Kinetics in Small Laboratory Animals	"A deep learning based MRF parameter mapping method is proposed for preclinical MRF data, and it uses a sliding-window averaging to extract spatial features and combines the use of map loss and recon loss.
It achieves a 4-fold further acceleration compared to the baseline MRF method, which should also be applicable to human MRF for acceleration."	My recommendation is mostly driven by the lack of technical novelty and the narrow application. The science is sound but lacks a broad impact.	The presented work aims to solve the existing problem of MRF acquisitions with a well explained framework achieving promising results.
142	DeepMIF: Deep learning based cell profiling for multispectral immunofluorescence images with graphical user interface	This study has great promising in the future, but the current framework needs further refinement. Cell detection is suggested to be replaced with cell segemntation. Secondly, the classification evaluation need to be further elaborated.	The problem addressed in the paper is quite important as accessible computational tools are essential for more efficient biomedical research. The paper is well-written and the results presented demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.	I think this is the best paper of my stack.
143	DeepPyramid: Enabling Pyramid View and Deformable Pyramid Reception for Semantic Segmentation in Cataract Surgery Videos	The paper looks technically correct, but there is no reason to include experiments and further discussions in supplementary material.	the novelties of this paper is limited and the experiments are not sufficient.	The proposed model is with limited novelty.
144	DeepRecon: Joint 2D Cardiac Segmentation and 3D Volume Reconstruction via A Structure-Specific Generative Method	The methodology is novel and the validation shows encouraging results. The validation could have been more complete.	Overall, this paper proposes a latent-space-based generation method for multiple medical image tasks. However, there are some concerns on the limited novelty, some unclear technical components, and insufficient evaluations.	I
145	Deformer: Towards Displacement Field Learning for Unsupervised Medical Image Registration	Overall, the paper is well-written and the proposed method is adequately evaluated. Although there are some concerns about the model complexity and novelty, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation and ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness and the registration performance of the proposed method. I believe this paper is of interest to the MICCAI community.	Lack of novelty.	Registration is sensitive to computation times, so I think the author may add GFLOPs and FPS information of every models.
146	Degradation-invariant Enhancement of Fundus Images via Pyramid Constraint Network	comparison to state of the art methods is not fair.	The paper is well written and easy to follow. The proposed PCE-Net and the Feature pyramid constraint are technically sound. Some drawbacks exist such as the inadequate discussion on FPC. considering all things, I recommend the acceptance of this paper.	"The idea combines the neural network models and image analysis methods. It is pretty intesting.
The organization and writing of the manuscript is satisfactory."
147	Delving into Local Features for Open-Set Domain Adaptation in Fundus Image Analysis	"good presentation on the methodology
clear evidence in numerical experiment on the advantage compared with existing art."	"The paper states that it is the first time to investigate the OSDA problem in fundus images.
The performance of the proposed methods is considerable.
The expression of the manuscript is good."	The proposed work is built on too-strong assumptions on the data and domains involved. Therefore, it is questionable whether the methodology is applicable in practice.
148	Denoising for Relaxing: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Fundus Image Segmentation without Source Data	Overall a very good paper to read. It's well written, properly formulated and motivated.	I gave the overall score considering the novelty and application of paper.	"The paper is well motivated, clearly written and well organized. The tackled problem is important for real-world applications, where the source data is not available for domain adaptation. The evaluation seems to be complete, as a lot of comparing methods and ablation studies are included.
However, there are some explanations missing in the formulas, such as not defined variables."
149	Denoising of 3D MR images using a voxel-wise hybrid residual MLP-CNN model to improve small lesion diagnostic confidence	"The topic of the paper is relevant and interesting to the MICCAI community.
It presents an innovative  idea to noise reduction of 3D MR images: deep learning technique based on a voxel-wise hybrid residual MLP-CNN model
The results are clearly presented and the conclusions are supported by the results.
Radiologist confirmation: the diagnosis confidence of small lesion is confirmed by radiologists."	The proposed method outperforms baseline in terms of both quantitative metrics and recovery of small lesions. However, the authors only experiment with simulated noise and ablation studies are lacking.	Novelty, experimental design, result presentation.
150	DentalPointNet: Landmark Localization on High-Resolution 3D Digital Dental Models	The novelty of the paper is limited, however, it addresses partially edentulous patients which is not studied before. It is an improvement on previous work and the improvements are not sufficient for a strong acceptance.	See strength.	The manuscript is well written; the methodology is well presented and provides all required details to allow the implementation of the method. The number of Figures and Tables are appropriate. The contribution of the proposed method is clearly communicated and the results have shown significant improvement compared to the other methods.
151	DeSD: Self-Supervised Learning with Deep Self-Distillation for 3D Medical Image Segmentation	The authors omitted previous studies on applying self-supervised learning to 3D medical images, and I believe such activity should not be encouraged. Also, important implementation details are missing, which makes the reproducibility questionable.	"I find it is hard to position this paper and hence acknowledge its contribution. This paper can be regarded as both an SSL paper and a segmentation paper. If we consider it as an SSL paper, then the current experiment is not enough to show the true SSL effectiveness. The mainstream SSL papers are all evaluated with image classification and standard benchmark datasets such as ImageNet. This paper does not conduct experiments with these settings, and hence it is unclear if it is really better than the mainstream approaches.
If we consider it as a segmentation paper, then the current experiment does not show the true segmentation effectiveness. The segmentation model used in this paper is a primitive one. It is unclear if the benefits demonstrated on that model can be readily transferred to more advanced segmentation models."	"The proposed method showed promising results.
However, the novelty of the proposed method is kind of limited."
152	DeStripe: A Self2Self Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Network with Unfolded Hessian for Stripe Artifact Removal in Light-sheet Microscopy	"The method is interesting, creative, and well-motivated by the problem statement. The results appear to be strong. 
The writing (clarity, grammar) is somewhat weak, so the content is harder to absorb than would be ideal. 
One piece of the architecture (the GNN) is not well-motivated.
The paper's rank in my stack could have been higher; I had to pick an order.
The paper rating could have been higher; I had to pick a number."	Although modelling the stripes in the Fourier domain is not novel, e.g., [8] in the paper's list of references, the gnn, optimization, and the comparison with existing methods makes it an acceptable paper.	I think it is a strong and interesting method, the results are very convincing.
153	Detecting Aortic Valve Pathology from the 3-Chamber Cine Cardiac MRI View	The paper tackles an important medical imaging topic, the topic is addressed in a convincing way. The algorithmic details are adequate and the paper is well-written and explains everything in detail.	Overall quite interesting, nonetheless very confusing on many parts, overall the lacks clarity, which could be solved with a better presentation (e.g. using graphical rather than textual description)	I found the manuscript well written and methodologically sound. Despite simple, the proposed pipeline is ingenious (with certain modules potentially applicable to other clinical tasks), provides interpretable results and shown a good overall performance. Despite the few weaknesses described above, these seem feasible to be corrected in the rebuttal phase (lack of methodological details limiting the reproducibility, limited discussion on the results, etc.), which could result in an interesting proceeding paper.
154	DEUE: Delta Ensemble Uncertainty Estimation for a More Robust Estimation of Ejection Fraction	Interesting method for uncertainty estimation in trained-up models, that could be of interest to wider applications.	Although a great deal of work has appeared in the last couple years on uncertainty, this is a new approach that other researches could easily evaluate on useful problems that require a fast run-time and limited computational resources during inference.	The task is interesting and the method of uncertainty estimation is efficient in time and memory.
155	DGMIL: Distribution Guided Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification	This paper uses multi-instance learning to solve the problem of pathological image classification from the perspective of data distribution, and the perspective is novel. However, this paper only conducts experiments on one dataset and lacks visualization results.	The paper is well-motivated and easy to follow, but it lacks details and explanations. Especially, the reported results are a bit unconvincing as are much lower than that in previous work.	Both strength and weakness are quite obvious and this manuscript is clearly a borderline paper. Currently I am willing to rate a weak accept due to its interesting idea and significance performance gain, which can be beneficial for the community.
156	Did You Get What You Paid For? Rethinking Annotation Cost of Deep Learning Based Computer Aided Detection in Chest Radiographs	The paper is clearly written. The conclusions are useful and convincing. However, the weakly-supervised segmentation algorithm can be improved.	Overall the experiments are extensive, and the results are convincing and insteresting.	The paper addresses a fundamental practical problem and, while the results are empirical, they provide several pointers for practitioners to reduce annotation costs. The proposed strategies could be easily replicated for other pathologies, although the same performance benefit may not be replicated.
157	Diffusion Deformable Model for 4D Temporal Medical Image Generation	I think it is very novel to adapt DDPM to image generation, especially generating continuous 4D data for cardiac cycle analysis.	This paper is sound and well-written.	My recommendation is accept because I believe that the proposed method is a nice methodological approach to solve the problem. My main concern is on the evaluation of the generated interpolation. The method is very difficult to evaluate due to the lack of ground truth. I believe that the authors performed reasonable experiments, although the selection of VoxelMorph as baseline should be further justified. I personally think that other methods could be more interesting and help for a better assessment of the proposed method.
158	Diffusion Models for Medical Anomaly Detection	Overall, the technical novelty of the proposed method is not enough and lack some vital experiential analysis. Hence, I recommend a weak reject for the paper right now.	While the paper is mainly an application, it is an important extension of a well-known computer vision technique to medical images. As such, I believe it would be a valuable contribution to the community.	Overall while some aspects of the paper are lacking I think the idea is interesting and works reasonably well and as such could be accepted (no one expects a first interesting idea to work perfectly from the get-go).
159	Digestive Organ Recognition in Video Capsule Endoscopy based on Temporal Segmentation Network	I made my decision based on the fact this paper is combination of existing methods.	Overall I am a bit torn and lean toward weak reject. If there were no issues with this paper at all (i.e. comparison with what limited previous works that exist (e.g. [11]), cleaned up explanation of how the data was split, discussion if the code and data will be released to the public, etc.) I might lean towards a very very weak accept simply because there are so few works published for this problem and the application novelty might be enough to carry this work for publication despite having no real technical novelty, but as the paper sits I cannot justify giving an acceptance rating.	"This is a very borderline rating, very weak reject. I recognise the paper has very interesting elements. However, it is at the moment unclear if the proposed algorithm is superior to the widely available literature on the topic, given that no comparisons are made, and no other justification is provided for why such methods do not need to be considered.
Open to review my assessment after the rebuttal discussion, with more information available."
160	Discrepancy and Gradient-guided Multi-Modal Knowledge Distillation for Pathological Glioma Grading	Except several small issues, the paper is well-written. Two major contributions properly addressed the presented challenges.	"Clearly written paper.
Solid mathematical insights and knowledge of how to include state-of-the-art advances in ML in a clinically relevant problem.
Open access datasets and (not yet released) code.
Awareness of relevant works in the area/task and properly comparing to them."	Good performance, inspiring idea of transferring multi-modal knowledge to unimodal model via knowledge distillation
161	Discrepancy-based Active Learning for Weakly Supervised Bleeding Segmentation in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Images	This paper studies important problem, presents technically sound approach, and reports promising results. These are major factors lead to the positive rate.	The paper brings an interesting method for active learning based weakly supervised segmentation.	The paper explore and exploit ideas from semi/weakly-supervised and propose a novel active learning pipeline. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the method over prior works. On the other hand, some design needs clearer insight and in-depth justification.
162	Disentangle then Calibrate: Selective Treasure Sharing for Generalized Rare Disease Diagnosis	"experiments and results are strong and comprehensive
paper is well written"	"Clearly written.
Interesting method applied to a relevant clinical problem.
Comparison with six recent papers."	The formulation of the problem as a few-shot-learning problem and the nice formulation of the GID module are the most interesting parts of the paper. The distribution calibration is per se not a new concept but the authors implement it in a slightly different manner. The final rating would  depend on the fairness of the comparisons. In case of an appropriate setup, I am willing to  upvote the paper.
163	DisQ: Disentangling Quantitative MRI Mapping of the Heart	Generally this paper is well-written, solving important and specific problem with novel solution and valid experiment results.	The presented work aims to ease the registration complexity in a real clinical need, disentangling both contrast and shape, which is quite novel in myocardial motion correction. My comments will hopefully improve the quality of the paper and clarify relevant aspects.	"The medical motivation of the work was not appropriately justified
The presentation of the results was confusing and unclear"
164	Distilling Knowledge from Topological Representations for Pathological Complete Response Prediction	It is very interesting work.	Overall, I like this paper. I think it is well motivated. But I think the authors are a bit distracted from the main benefit (efficiency). And the empirical evaluation is not sufficiently convincing currently. I am happy to increase my scores as long as my concerns are addressed.	Although there are some ambiguities that are addressed in section 5, the authors' approach to studying the very vital medical treatment prediction, pCR, is novel by incorporating topological features and CNN ones. Topological features can be a great informative feature as a complementary counterpart with other ubiquitous image-based features.  The outperformance of the proposed model with a clear benchmark comparison is another reason for the reviewer to recommend this paper.
165	Domain Adaptive Mitochondria Segmentation via Enforcing Inter-Section Consistency	The authors address domain adaptive mitochondria segmentation by  enforcing inter-section consistency. The exploration of  inter-section consistency for this task stands for its novelty. The work presents an extensive experimental section. Moreover, the paper is clear and well written.  There also some issues in this study. For example, the performance of the  NoAdapt for adaptation from MitoEM-R to MitoEM-H in Table 2  is  exceptionally low,which may mislead the readers.	The method is based on a 2D model. 3D models are the state-of-the-art for this task for several years and should be used to show the effects of the introduced methods on actual applications. Given the comparison to other 2D models, it could still be argued that this is not a sole reason for rejection. However, the fact that there is ample reason to believe that a 3D model would not work with the proposed inter-section consistency means that this work will have limited impact.	Developing models with the constraint of data scarsity is of great interest to the community. To this end, the authors propose a simple, elegant yet effective approach for improving UDA for 3D EM mitochondria segmentation. Such an approach potentially can be extended to other 3D imaging modalities and applications. The experimental validation is solid and extensive.
166	Domain Adaptive Nuclei Instance Segmentation and Classification via Category-aware Feature Alignment and Pseudo-labelling	It is an overall good paper but the method part is not clear enough. Thus I tend to give weak accept.	The paper presents an interesting approach using feature alignment and self-training with competitive results over the baselines. The main limitation of this paper is that it doesn't adequately discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, e.g., it is well-known that the type of self-supervised learning in this paper could result in model deterioration and poor calibration.	reproduced
167	Domain Specific Convolution and High Frequency Reconstruction based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation	novelty and effectivess.	I enjoyed reading the paper because of its novel extension and also the experiments design.	The description of DSC module and some experimental results make me confused, as I mentioned before.
168	Domain-Adaptive 3D Medical Image Synthesis: An Efficient Unsupervised Approach	The proposed method sounds interesting and novel, but it's hard to decide whether the improvement is statistically significant or not. Also, there's no comparison with the other competing methods.	"The concept makes sense to me.
It does beat the baselines, but results are not completely convincing."	The authors address a novel topic, clearly formulating their contribution. Their setup and evaluation are properly designed and, from my perspective, do not contain explicit mistakes. Most of my comments are directed on the minor improvements of the paper that could be addressed at the proof-reading stage.
169	Domain-Prior-Induced Structural MRI Adaptation for Clinical Progression Prediction of Subjective Cognitive Decline	"Lack of technical novelty
Non-persuasive framework to solve the problem
Lack of comparison with SOTA methods, especially, domain adaptation"	The motivation of this paper is clear, the innovation is limited, and the experiments are complete	Excellent submission - well-written; technically sound; thoroughly evaluated; high-quality figures; extensive investigations such as ablation studies, hyperparameter anlaysis
170	DOMINO: Domain-aware Model Calibration in Medical Image Segmentation	The authors introduce a novel approach to tuning deep learning algorithms. This approach could help improve model accuracy. The paper is very detailed and gives a step by step of the approach, the reason behind the approach, and does a detailed quantitative analysis on the output of models tuned, untuned, and against a widely used algorithm. This is solid work that can be expanded and used across many different deep learning algorithms solving different problems, other than segmentation.	"This work is very interesting, the proposal makes sense, and the manuscript very well written. There are a few items (""marketing"" and generalizability) that I think the authors should consider."	
171	Double-Uncertainty Guided Spatial and Temporal Consistency Regularization Weighting for Learning-based Abdominal Registration	"novel training scheme for learning based registration with state-of-the-art results on 10 abdominal CT-MRI pairs
well written manuscript"	This work provided a double-uncertainty-guided spatial and temporal consistency regularization weighting strategy to relieve the weight tuning. Experiments on abdominal CT-MRI registration have shown promising advances by the proposed strategy.	This contribution could be deemed innovative, but perhaps requires more detailed study of various choices and model implementation.  It was not easy to follow details of the model itself.
172	DRGen: Domain Generalization in Diabetic Retinopathy Classification	Interesting paper but analysis could have been more informative.	Theoretical analysis and experimental results are both insufficient.	Even if this work is not about a completely novel method in domain generalization, it shows to improve an existing method and it is the first time it is applied to the chosen dataset. Therefore, I believe that this work is interesting for the community, provided the comments above are addressed in the manuscript.
173	DS3-Net: Difficulty-perceived Common-to-T1ce Semi-Supervised Multimodal MRI Synthesis Network	The paper focuses on the multi-modal MRI synthesis task, which is interesting and has a number of practical applications on both research and clinical sides. The proposed method has some novelty and provides satisfactory performance. However, the experiments should be strengthened and more efforts should be made to clarify the contributions of this work. Considering these factors, I would like to give this paper this credit.	They proposed a Difficulty-perceived common-to-T1ce Semi-Supervised multimodal MRI Synthesis network (DS3-Net), involving both paired and unpaired data together with dual-level knowledge distillation to address issues related to acquire T1ce.	Overall the performance of DS^3-net with only 5% paired data and 95% unpaired data is appealing compared with the baselines with all paired data. The advices above could make this draft easy-to-follow and easy-to-generalize in other image synthesis tasks.
174	DSP-Net: Deeply-Supervised Pseudo-Siamese Network for Dynamic Angiographic Image Matching	The authors has proposed an effective method to automatically match the intra-operative X-ray fluoroscopic images to the dynamic angiographic images. However, the segmentation of the guidewire and vessels is achived by an existing method, the projection method or the registration method has not been introduced clearly, and the time cost evaluation is not available.	"The paper is clearly structured and logically sound.
It has some bright spots, the experiments are adequate, and the experimental results have been improved compared to other methods.
But, as the datasets are not from the clinic, the clinical use effect is uncertain, and there are also problems such as unclear description of some details and lack of supporting materials."	"Clear contributions and organization.
Solid work and contributions.
Extensive comaparison."
175	DSR: Direct Simultaneous Registration for Multiple 3D Images	Nice mathematical idea, but (in light of missing computation times, and similar performance than existing methods) limit practical use.	The paper hold huge clinical benefit, however, the authors need to brush up their clinical motivation of applying this to 3D TEE image. The results looks promising for both simulated and in-vivo studies.	The work is interesting for a reduced community.
176	Dual-Branch Squeeze-Fusion-Excitation Module for Cross-Modality Registration of Cardiac SPECT and CT	The proposed method achieved the best result for the rigid SPECT/CT registration task over an in-house dataset  compared to current multi-modal approaches. Although no evaluation has been performed on real data, the artificial transformations look sufficient and promising for this conference paper.	It would be great to clearly state that the paper focuses on rigid image registration and not deformable image registrations? Could there be potential deformations as well in case of SPECT vs. CT that might needed to be modeled. Also, authors should compare their method with at least one approach that specifically focuses on feature fusion.	This is a very good submission with clear organization, interesting novelty, and strong experimental validation. I would recommend acceptance of this paper.
177	Dual-Distribution Discrepancy for Anomaly Detection in Chest X-Rays	The paper proposed novel uncertainty estimation methods by utilizing the unlabeled data for uncertainty and normal cases. This is the first work to do so and provide an alternative way to explore the uncertainty estimation for medical analysis in detection. The proposed methods reach state-of-the-art performance, which is promising and the ablation study shows the performance increased while including more diverse data.  A concern about the robustness of this model as the abnormal data is applied for training.	This paper is generally good, and has a new perspective on this field. But it's better to be able to answer my related questions and be accepted for publication.	The paper is well written and novelty can be deemed as sufficient. Some of the weakness can be addressed. (See above for details)
178	Dual-graph Learning Convolutional Networks for Interpretable Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis	This paper is well organized and give a new interpretable method, which is interesting and novel.	Overall the paper is well written and easy to follow. My one major concern is lack of enough samples while training and testing and use of conventional correlation metric for generating graphs.	see above
179	Dual-HINet: Dual Hierarchical Integration Network of Multigraphs for Connectional Brain Template Learning	The proposed method to learn CBT from brain multigraphs is interesting, but further evaluation is needed to demonstrate its effectiveness.	The novelty and the methodology is good, but the organization of the paper needs improving.	The proposed method is very complex with multiple GCN modules and clustering modules. However, the current writing of this paper did not provide enough technical details making this paper less convincing.
180	DuDoCAF: Dual-Domain Cross-Attention Fusion with Recurrent Transformer for Fast Multi-contrast MR Imaging	The organization, motivation, novelty look good to me. For experiments, while selection of dataset has some defects, other parts, the baselines and under-sampling strategies are still reasonable and comprehensive.	The authors need to provide enough experimental data for method validation.	Novelty, experimental design, result presentation.
181	Dynamic Bank Learning for Semi-supervised Federated Image Diagnosis with Class Imbalance	"Well written.
The idea is relatively novel.
Good results."	The interesting task and setting for medical FL. Significant performance improvements. Improper primary metric for evaluation.	The overall quality of this paper is good. The only concern is that the server needs data for training, which does not follow standard FL protocol and raise privacy concerns. Besides, in the experiments, the labeled data on the server seem to be a subset of the client-side data, which may cause privacy leakage.
182	EchoCoTr: Estimation of the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction from Spatiotemporal Echocardiography	Mainly motivated by the limited methodogical originality and applicative impact of this work, as mentioned above.	"Authors explain their paper, show all the experiments and work done, and compare and quantify themselves against other existent methods.
Also, they show the clinical importance of their method."	The paper beats the state of the art on the EchoNet dynamic dataset, which is the new standard for the LVEF prediction on 2D echocardiograms, but there is not much novelty.
183	EchoGNN: Explainable Ejection Fraction Estimation with Graph Neural Networks	Many strengths and minor weaknesses, as detailed above. The paper reads easily, is elegant and has the benefit of using well executed and combined past contributions from the field. A MICCAI exemplar.	"This is a good work overall with added bonus of explainability and good results. However, as I've written above the explaination provided by the model is perhaps not very interesting clinically.

Some technical portion could also use more clarification and consideration."	A well written submission that clearly describes the network and its advantages over previous work. The clinical application is highly relevant, as non-expert users of echo (point-of-care) will benefit from reliable detection of EF and insight on explainability. The paper could be more convincing if more emphasis were put on the discussion of the results in a clinical context.
184	Edge-oriented Point-cloud Transformer for 3D Intracranial Aneurysm Segmentation	The authors present a novel point-based method for 3D intracranial aneurysm segmentation. The method aims to pay more attention to the target boundary. The edge oriented segmentation method can be applied to other segmentation tasks in the 3D medical image domain.	Clinical relevance is doubtful and experimental dataset is small.	See my comments above.
185	Effective Opportunistic Esophageal Cancer Screening using Noncontrast CT Imaging	The authors proposed a good idea to improve the tumor segmentation performance by proposing the position-sensitive self-attention layer for each encoding layer in the segmentation network nnUnet. This a well novelty. However, its method seems to not be described clearly, which influence the reproducibility.	This seems to be a pretty strong paper, but the lack of statistical analysis is a major weakness.	The experiments were very complete and meticulous.
186	Efficient Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation for nnU-Net	The novelty is good and the field is interesting.	This paper seems to be a very important contribution in the domain of biomedical image segmentation, since it provides an uncertainty scheme to the state-of-the-Art architecture that nnU-net is, which was not obvious to develop (as explained in the paper). Furthermore, its performance is boosted, leading to a new state-of-the-Art segmentation method.	"I'm okay with a paper with limited novelty but with extensive experiments and ablation studies to distill the key factors that can contribute to the community. The authors cite Snapshot ensemble [13] in their paper but present no discussion/comparison between the proposed method and Snapshot ensemble. In my opinion, it is more like purposeful behavior. That's why I downgrade my rating.
I would raise my score if the authors could address my concerns."
187	Efficient Biomedical Instance Segmentation via Knowledge Distillation	The writing structure of this article is clear and the approach is reasonable	Novel ideas for an important problem, detailed evaluation shows superiority compared to state-of-the-art	"The paper is well written and easy to follow. The proposed distillation method is novel and the experimental results demonstrate its advantage. Although there are some missing details, they are not the major issues.
Therefore, my initial rating is accept."
188	Efficient population based hyperparameter scheduling for medical image segmentation	the utility of this method seems limited to cases where models with good initial hyper-paramaters are already known. We cannot assume this is the case for all problems.	The paper proposes a modified PBT, with restricted hyperparameter search space and starting from a set of default parameters. This does reduce the computational overhead of PBT - which makes it feasible to train for 3D medical networks, but it also comes with the drawback of the restricted search space.  The performance improvement over the default values is small, and the authors do not compare with other simple optimization approaches like simple grid search.	This paper presents a good hyperparameter tuning strategy based on PBT. However, the current version needs more solid validation to prove its efficiency.
189	Electron Microscope Image Registration using Laplacian Sharpening Transformer U-Net	See above - nice methodological framework, questionable experiments and moderately convincing results.	I think the authors did a great job describing the method and comparing it with state of the art soltuons, but I think the contribution they are making lacks of technical novelty.	The authors integrate ideas from related work and apply them to particular application. Novelty is limited, but results of combination of Swin-UNet with Sharp UNet for image registration have not been reported before to the best of my knowledge.
190	Embedding Gradient-based Optimization in Image Registration Networks	The methodology and the advantage of having two optimisation process is not clear enough, well explained and discuss.	I see in this paper an interesting idea that has potential and should be presented to the scientific community. I hope the authors will revise their manuscript a bit more so that it is a bit clearer.	Minor rearrangements and extensions in the methods section and the addition of explanations in the experiments section can raise the paper to a good level very quickly. The weaknesses presented can be easily elliminated.
191	Embedding Human Brain Function via Transformer	The work provides an approach on representing regularity and variability of human brain function in a latent space of Transformer, and uses the embeding vectors to identify the brain state, experimental results demonstrate it effective.	I give this score mainly based on the soundness of the methodology and the experimental design.	I think this simple application of transformer to fMRI is valuable to the MICCAI community. It is well written, an interesting approach with good results.
192	End-to-End cell recognition by point annotation	novelty and experiments.	The contribution is sufficient. There are few things can be improved. The introduction of the point-based problem. What is the preset anchor point. How to get the center point, etc.	The method is novel and effective. The data and experiments section are somewhat vague.
193	End-to-End Evidential-Efficient Net for Radiomics Analysis of Brain MRI to Predict Oncogene Expression and Overall Survival	This work presents an innovative use of the evidential deep learning framework in classifying MGMT status from multiparametric MRI scans. The study utilizes a large publicly available dataset and outperforms many of the existing state-of-the-art.	Both the motivation and architecture of the proposed model are incorrect.	The paper introduced a novel method and tested it on comprehensive standard dataset. The results were analyzed carefully and external comparisons have been performed. Model justification and result discussion were relatively well done.
194	End-to-end Learning for Image-based Detection of Molecular Alterations in Digital Pathology	This is a reasonable approach for an important problem. The paper is well written and results are compelling.	No comparisons with end-to-end pipelines especially when these are widely available  via GitHub and easy to run.	Authors failed to show that an end-to-end approach is better than a two stage approach.
195	End-to-end Multi-Slice-to-Volume Concurrent Registration and Multimodal Generation	Well written paper, describing a well working method that demonstrates in a credible manner that the state of the art is improved upon.	Overall, the paper is interesting, however, chaotic and hard to follow. The concepts are not presented in clear way and the manuscript requires several passes to fully understand the presented concept.	"I think this is a good paper and it should be accepted. I particularly liked the novel end-to-end approach of coupling the adversarial method with registration, showing that this offers significant advantages over separate sequential methods. However, the building blocks themselves are not new, and the novelty is limited to combining them in an end-to-end approach. In addition, some relevant aspects are not discussed in full detail, and the evaluation is limited to some extent, so the paper is more at the proof-of-concept level. It is difficult to foresee how generalizable the method will be.
In summary, therefore, I believe that this is a fair paper that should be accepted."
196	End-to-End Segmentation of Medical Images via Patch-wise Polygons Prediction	"*	Novel approach for segmentation using neural renderers.
*	Unsatisfactory paper organization.
*	Unclear optimization of internal parameters and risk of overestimation of the performance."	"The technique is well designed.
The results are considerable.
The clarity and organization of the manuscript is poor."	In general, the presentation is lack of illustration for readers to follow. The proposed segmentation method is novel and the experimental results demonstrate its advantage. My main concern is the presentation of the paper only slight above average. Therefore, my initial rating is weak accept.
197	Enforcing connectivity of 3D linear structures using their 2D projections	Original idea and convincing results (even taking into account that parameters of compared methods may not be optimal). Best paper in my stack.	The main idea is really nice and weights more for me than problems with reproducibility, I believe MICCAI audience will like this work.	Limited technical novelty, and weak and unexplained assumptions heavily undermine the empirical evidence of performance improvement. Hence I recommend rejection.
198	Enhancing model generalization for substantia nigra segmentation using a test-time normalization-based method	"Marginal contribution.
No comparison of the proposal against SOTA methods.
No conclusions."	This was a solid paper that gave a very detailed description of the method. The authors considered previous methods and implemented methods they thought could increase accuracy of their model. They even generalized to publicly available data. They used an atlas in this case because publicly those datasets did not provide annotations. The novelty is not only in the approach but in the fact that they used T2-weighted images to do the segmentation, knowing that this is an image that is typically available. Other groups have tried to solve this problem using the T2-weighted image, however, this does not take away from the novelty of this method.	Although this work could be potentially beneficial towards diagnosing one of the neurodegenerative disorders, the novelty is not substantial enough to be acceptable considering MICCAI standards. Further, the qualitatively results do not clearly showcase the essence of this approach in segmenting the desired structures.
199	Ensembled Prediction of Rheumatic Heart Disease from Ungated Doppler Echocardiography Acquired in Low-Resource Settings	I liked the work done by the authors and the paper was written well. But there were too many details left out or presented with a lack of clarity for this to be of a standard to be accepted at the MICCAI main conference.	Excellent presentation, compelling clinical problem, logical methodology, good dataset and evaluation.	"The major factors are:

a new and exciting task
impact on the community and society

The paper brings a good problem and application to the community, which leads the rate to a positive side. However, some unignorable weaknesses lead the score to a 'weak accept'."
200	Estimating Model Performance under Domain Shifts with Class-Specific Confidence Scores	Low innovation level of the work. Unconvincing experiment & results.	The novelty is low, but the addressed problem is important and the proposed method seems effective. I therefore suggest a weak accept.	The quality of this paper is above average. The content is clear, the authors clearly explain the novelty of their methods and the results are good.
201	Evidence fusion with contextual discounting for multi-modality medical image segmentation	the paper explores the segmentation and fusion of multi model MRI from a Dempster-Shafer theory, but essential trains  4 encoder-decoder networks with a fusion module, which lack a substantial novelty. the evaluation lacks sota method comparisons.	"The paper has good potential.
It is well written.
Thorough experiments and ablation study are done."	The proposed method is novel, but the description and writing is relatively poor.
202	Evolutionary Multi-objective Architecture Search Framework: Application to COVID-19 3D CT Classification	"From the perspective of models,

The author proposes a new object for optimize, namely potential. The author should put more clearly on the definition. In formula 3, the calculation of potential is confusing. What is the meaning of multiply a vector of number of epochs and its inverse? Why is the higher the potential, the more promising the model?
The one-sample mini-batch is controversial. I think such a trick cannot be included in mini-batch range.
What is the border line between exploitation and exploration? Under what circumstances we choose exploitation?
From the perspective of experiments,
In the right bottom picture of fig 1, the author points out three kinds of points. But what do the x-axis and y-axis mean? The title is missing.
The fig 2 and fig 3 is hard to track. It is better to affiliate the conclusion with the title.
From the perspective of writings and organization,
There are many typos that need to be fixed. In fig 1, the one hot vector is wrong for MBConv"	While I find the evaluation a bit narrow based on only one task (3D chest CT classification), the paper overall is well written and results are convincingly presented and are promising. Therefore, I would tend to accept this work.	As mentioned before, the novelty of the method.
203	Explainable Contrastive Multiview Graph Representation of Brain, Mind, and Behavior	"Too much details are missing for the whole model. e.g.  rare hyper parameters were provided; how edge of graph was defined? no time-window used for dynamic FC? why distillation is necessary? 
And for sex classification result, it's better to compare to other published methods, since a lot methods have been proposed for this problem with better results."	Interesting topic and novel idea.	the fusion manner of multimodal imaging is impressive
204	Explaining Chest X-ray Pathologies in Natural Language	Natural language explanations are relevant but underexplored.  This paper contributes a new dataset and approach.  Unfortunately, several aspects seem to be asserted without strong enough basis, and the limitations in scope of the resulting dataset are not sufficiently discussed.	"Altough the new data is useful but paper lacks discussion. The motivation and detailed discussion is missing.
Title of a paper is misleading, explaining refers to show that method is explainable with visualization. Paper lacks the visualization."	New large-scale, annotated dataset and new evaluation framework for chest X-ray analysis with natural language explanations.
205	Exploring Smoothness and Class-Separation for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation	The paper applies previously proposed methods to a new scenario, medical imaging. From a theoretical perspective, the novelty is very limited. However, considering the motivation is clear and inspiring, I recommend a weak accept based on the understanding that the authors will release their codes.	I appreciate the insights and good use of figures in this paper to support their claims. Therefore, I lean to acceptance.	The contribution is a little bit over-claimed and this work has limited technical novelty.
206	Extended Electrophysiological Source Imaging with Spatial Graph Filters	see comments above	The paper is of good quality and of interest for publication the idea behind the use of the method has ground and the results presented are very good since outperform methods that are being used for year as sota. There is a need for clarifications on the comparison between those methods especially for the tuning of the hyperparameters.	"In general, this paper is well written. The major factors are as follows:
1 The contributions are clearly demonstrated.
2 The paper is technially sound as the verifications of this work is sufficient.
3 The presentation is acceptable."
207	FairPrune: Achieving Fairness Through Pruning for Dermatological Disease Diagnosis	The proposal is novel and the results are sufficient.	The topic is very interesting and the method is intuitive and well-explained. The experiments were repeated only once, the use of the wording privileged/unprivileged groups was confusing and there was little explanation to why gender in the case of skin disease classification is considered sensitive data. However, the discussed topic is interesting and the method could be widely applicable in such scenarios.	The points I raised above are relatively minor. The paper has novelty, is well-written and the experiments are extensive. The subject of fairness in AI for medical imaging is topical and one which I expect to grow in years to come, hence I believe there will be significant interest in this paper.
208	Fast Automatic Liver Tumor Radiofrequency Ablation Planning via Learned Physics Model	Very interesting paper backed up with novelty	The idea of this paper is quite insteresting, and the results are good. However, the method part is not described clear and not easy for readers to follow.	Further clarification (see questions above) on novelty and results would greatly strengthen the paper.
209	Fast FF-to-FFPE Whole Slide Image Translation via Laplacian Pyramid and Contrastive Learning	The paper is well written and it is easy to follow. The method however seems like a small incremental modification of the now commonly used CycleGAN.	The testing data and evaluation part is confusing.	This paper is interesting but the quality and not the speed should be the focus
210	Fast Spherical Mapping of Cortical Surface Meshes using Deep Unsupervised Learning	See my comments above.	Clear novelty and outstanding performance.	FreeSurfer plays a significant role in medical imaging. The proposed work has fewer distortions and is 200-times faster than FreeSurfer.
211	Fast Unsupervised Brain Anomaly Detection and Segmentation with Diffusion Models	As mentioned before	This well-written and well-organized paper is methodologically sound, and the evaluation is comprehensive. I believe it will be interested to the community.	While I think the idea is interesting and it is great to see new unsupervised applications for deep neural networks that heavily rely on supervised training, there are some concerns that make me hesitate about the paper. The methodology seems to be unnecessarily obfuscated. I think it would have been much more valuable to give a general intuition about why these two methods need to be combined. Finally, the contrast between the synthetic results and real ones makes me feel weary about the contribution. According to the results, it is really hard to say that the proposal can actually address segmentation in real scenarios.
212	Feature Re-calibration based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification	The paper is valuable and is well written. Addresses an interesting problem.	Please see weaknesses section.	Details are available in the main strengths of the paper.
213	Feature robustness and sex differences in medical imaging: a case study in MRI-based Alzheimer's disease detection	Experiments and results detailed in this paper are not enough to guarant presentation at MICCAI.	"CNN and logistic regression are already widely used algorithms. There is no contribution regarding the method.
Age is not considered, which is important.
One of the main challenges is the classification between MCI and HC, which was not carried out."	Well designed and described study with an important message for a community that extensively works on the computer-aided diagnosis/progonosis of AD with ML/DL.
214	Federated Medical Image Analysis with Virtual Sample Synthesis	VAT is firstly introduced to federated learning, though the evaluation section may not be sufficient.	It is a good paper with clear presentation, novel idea and sound experimental results. The concern mentioned in weaknesses is minor.	This paper proposes an interesting and novel idea of synthesizing virtual samples to help tackle the non-iid issue in FL. The proposed method is validated on six public datasets with significant performance improvements. However, I still have some concerns regarding the calculation or the term r, the model convergence, and the insufficient additional analytical studies.
215	Federated Stain Normalization for Computational Pathology	A combination of too many missing pieces and weak assertions. Although the paper makes for a reasonable read, it does not seem to meet the standards I have come to expect of MICCAI publications	novelty of idea and experiments	This paper presents a BottleGAN generative model for computational alignment of staining styles of many laboratories. The purpose is to apply deep federated learning in computational pathology for creation of datasets that reflect diversities of many laboratories. This can really be of great practical importance. In this regard, the authors offered solution for the major obstacles: how to solve problem created by different privacy-protected staining-styles protocols in laboratories supposed to cooperate in creating large datasets necessary for deep networks training.
216	FedHarmony: Unlearning Scanner Bias with Distributed Data	There are some interesting insights presented regarding Federated Learning with respect to the problem of not being able to recognize image scanner acquisition sites. The most interesting ideas from the paper have to do with the experimental results found when combining these 3 particular loss terms (proximal loss, domain prediction loss and confusion loss), and the idea that obtain reasonable age prediction results while reducing the ability to identify the scanner/ site where the data came from.	As above, timely, practical, nicely demonstrated. Longer term needs more validation, but great as a MICCAI presentation.	The paper is generally interesting. Although the evaluation is limited to age prediction, which is not a commonly explored task in neuroimage analyses, the general idea and the ablations make the paper an interesting topic for discussion at MICCAI.
217	Few-shot Generation of Personalized Neural Surrogates for Cardiac Simulation via Bayesian Meta-Learning	Overall, this paper contributes a novel idea and shows impressive results, it would be great if it is presented better.	The proposed meta-model shows significantly worse MSE, according to Table 1, so the proposed meta-learning strategy has not been sufficiently corroborated.	The major factors are the unclear motivations and the confusing results.
218	Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation Regularized with Self-reference and Contrastive Learning	Though their proposed regularization improve performance of the model, novelty and the comparison are limited.	The paper presents a novel solution to the few-shot semantic segmentation that relies on the use of several techniques to improve on existing methods. Using only two datasets of the same body region hinders the generalization of the proposed method and consequently slightly diminishes the impact of the work.	The method includes two contributions. They are both simple and effective. But the contrastive learning part is not novel. The self-reference is novel as there seems to be no paper did the exactly the same modification for few shot semantic segmentation task.
219	FFCNet: Fourier Transform-Based Frequency Learning and Complex Convolutional Network for Colon Disease Classification	The paper is well written, but I am not convinced that it performs better in comparison to more advanced networks such as transformers or CoAtNet.	The paper is well-motivated, propose a method for automatic colon disease classification and demonstrate good performance. However, the methodology part is not clearly illustrated and the technical innovation is not convincing.	Overall I am happy to see an interesting and new approach to a decently well studied problem. Even if the results are not particularly groundbreaking and there are some issues with overclaimed novelty, I would still favor a very weak acceptance just to get a conversation going in the community about possible uses of complex neural networks through a Fourier decoupling procedure such as this.
220	Fine-grained Correlation Loss for Regression	"1.The novelty is limited since two correlation losses have been presented before.

The experimental setting is insufficient and more comparison experiments and ablation studies should be designed"	The idea is interesting, and the method and validations are well-documented.	Despite the novelty and interpretability of the work, the unsound experiments and improper wording lead to a score of 4.
221	Flat-aware Cross-stage Distilled Framework for Imbalanced Medical Image Classification	interesting paper where merits slightly weigh over weakness	Manuscript is well written and ideas and methodology well structured and presented. Experiments are solid and the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.	Due to the reasons above, I recommend a weak accept for this paper.
222	Flexible Sampling for Long-tailed Skin Lesion Classification	"The paper is well written and the ideas are well presented
The idea makes a lot of sense 
The experimental results are extensive"	The proposed method is intriguing, but further analysis/discuss/evaluation is needed.	The paper's method does shows improvements on skin lesion classification through a well executed experimental setup.
223	fMRI Neurofeedback Learning Patterns are Predictive of Personal and Clinical Traits	The organization of the paper is good, but the motivation is poor and the method is not clear description.	There is potential for clinical applications.	Overall seems to be a reasonable approach but with some major concerns
224	Free Lunch for Surgical Video Understanding by Distilling Self-Supervisions	The challenge tackled by this paper and the proposed strategy are relevant. This strategy includes three components already published, but remains novel since this combination has never been evaluated and applied to surgical video understanding. The missing existing works do not impact the novelty of this work. This paper appears to me quite promising, encouraging a significant number of additional experiments to see how far we can reach with using already trained models for the problems of surgery video understanding. Because it opens a new door for this problem, I think that the paper can be accepted in MICCAI.	Clear motivation and clinical relevance, novel method with clear description, complete experiments to show the impact.	The authors proposed an effective self-supervised approach for surgical workflow recognition and obtained better results, specifically in the less labeled data regime. The authors should consider addressing points discussed above.
225	Frequency-Aware Inverse-Consistent Deep Learning for OCT-Angiogram Super-Resolution	The novelty is clear but needs more experiments to support the novelty.	The innovation of the paper and the rationality of the evaluation index	The integration of frequency components into unpaired learning frameworks for resolution enhancement of optical coherence tomography angiography seem interesting. However, this work should be further improved in terms of method description and experiments.
226	From Images to Probabilistic Anatomical Shapes: A Deep Variational Bottleneck Approach	The problem this work aims to address is clearly defined - capture the data non-linearity in shape modeling and improve uncertainty quantification. The proposed methodology is novel showing improved performance in terms of both uncertainty quantification and shape modeling compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	The proposed framework seems to be novel, and the validation is convincing.	Overall, the paper was well-written and included relevant explanations and experiments that demonstrated the uniqueness and advantages of the proposed method, respectively. I have some reservations about whether or not the proposed method is novel enough to be considered a new method (conv + MLP and beta-VAE loss), but I think in conjunction with the shape modeling task and performed experiments, it may still be of interest to the MICCAI community.
227	FSE Compensated Motion Correction for MRI Using Data Driven Methods	The study showed importance of using realistic motion artifacts for training for motion correction approaches.	Clearly motivated and well implemented; well written with neat figures; commitment to sharing code	Novel, interesting and insightful idea. Simple yet elegant method design. Superior performance in experimental results. However, lacks results on real data.
228	Fusing Modalities by Multiplexed Graph Neural Networks for Outcome Prediction in Tuberculosis	This paper presents an apparently novel but intuitive solution to an important problem in machine learning analysis of multi-modal data. The data used for testing is appropriate, and the results are promising.	"Interesting and novel approach for multimodal fusion via multiplexed-GNN. Demonstration on a ""truly multimodal"" dataset with 5 modalities (internally even 6, considering categorical and numeric clinical features as separate modalities). Convincing results, including an interesting ablation study and comparison to several baselines."	The problem is clinically relevant and it proposes to use a large variety (drug regimen, chest x-ray, demographic, clinical, genomic)   of types of data for outcome prediction. The experiments are adequate and clearly described. Statistical significance is shown to prove improvements over a large number of baselines including a monoplex graph based representation
229	FUSSNet: Fusing Two Sources of Uncertainty for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation	My main two concerns were the lack of a clear statement of contributions, and the lack of clarity about aspects of the validation, especially hyperparameter optimisation.	The paper lacks technical contribution, however has potential room for discussion since this simple idea has produced good results. Hence, I recommend weak acceptance in the initial round.	"Focus on uncertainty is one of the strongest points of the paper, however the method is relatively complex, while gains over other methods may not be overly significant. Also, one of the main claims/novelties, the one regarding aleatoric uncertainty, turns out to provide only minimal benefit.
My main criticism is that the evaluation is not 100% convincing given that only single experiment results are being reported (instead of mean+-std.dev. over multiple randomized runs) using very small number of training datasets. Especially in this low data regime, random selection of training datasets can have a huge impact. But since the results of FUSSNet are somewhat outperforming all other methods in both experiments, assuming the authors have not hand-picked results, I am eager to learn more details at about their work at MICCAI."
230	GaitForeMer: Self-Supervised Pre-Training of Transformers via Human Motion Forecasting for Few-Shot Gait Impairment Severity Estimation	A novel method that first use pre-training models to deal with small sample size problem in this field.	The manuscript is clear and easy to follow, and the results are plausible. But the novelty is incremental.	further evaluation needed in terms of performance metrices such as area under roc and area under precision recall curve
231	GazeRadar: A Gaze and Radiomics-guided Disease Localization Framework	"Combining radiomics and attention without the segmentation aspect.
Unclear methods description.
insufficient metrics for comparison."	"Clinically relevant
The network is novel
Properly evaluated on several benchmarks and the results demonstrate the effectivness."	Technical novelty, reproducibility, and results achieved.
232	Geometric Constraints for Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation on Laparoscopic Images with Dual-task Consistency	The addressed application is very relevant to the MICCAI topics. The technical novelty of this paper is adequate and validation has been conducted rigorously which also includes an ablation study. The authors have compared their approach to several state-of-the-art approaches and the results have demonstrated that their approach performs better.	"The method seems sound, it is interesting that the two presented tasks seem to complement each other even though they are very similar. As mentioned above, the only larger thing I'm missing is a small discussion why this works (or at least references explaining it).
The explanation is mostly clear and can likely be made clearer by making minor changes to the variable names etc.
There are multiple language errors, but nothing serious."	This paper proposed a new framework to deal with the special challenges in laparoscopic depth estimation. Although some aspects need more clarification, this work can provide insight for the area, especially its novelty of using dual-task consistency from scene coordinate prediction to improve the depth quality.
233	Gigapixel Whole-Slide Images Classification using Locally Supervised Learning	Good innovation with questionable experments. I just accepted to give the paper chance to survive.	The idea of using locally supervised learning for WSI representation learning is interesting. However, the paper may not be ready for publication in its current form. Please refer to the weaknesses section for more detailed comments.	Innovation of method and strong evaluation
234	Global Multi-modal 2D/3D Registration via Local Descriptors Learning	The method seems sound, and results are promising on a challenging task.	Although the method is not particularly novel and results still needs a bit improvement, the paper is very clearly written and has a very good clinical relevance.	The novelty of the approach is a little bit limited.
235	GradMix for nuclei segmentation and classification in imbalanced pathology image datasets	The authors propose a new nuclei augmentation method to boost the rare nuclei segmentation and classification. While based on the experiments, the improvement is  limited and not convincing enough.	The paper targets an important problem. The proposed method shows performance improvements on two datasets.	Class imbalance in nuclei is a common and realistic problem for nuclei segmentation and classification in pathology. With GradMix which is the proposed data augmentation technique to overcome class imbalance, Table 3 shows results of nuclei classification are improved. Specifically, F1-scores of miscellaneous nuclei (a rare class) in both datasets increased more than other nuclei types when using GradMix. For the first dataset, F^M increased by 0.035 while F^E and F^L changed less than 0.01. For CoNSeP, F^M increased by 0.011 while F^E increased by 0.016 and F^I and F^S changed less than 0.01. Showing more improvements in miscellaneous nuclei would meet the main purpose of GradMix.
236	Graph convolutional network with probabilistic spatial regression: application to craniofacial landmark detection from 3D photogrammetry	Proposes a sensible solution to an interesting problem, and demonstrates that it works.	The paper indicated novel extensions of GCN to make it applicable for landmark detection in 3D facial photogrammetry. The paper is very well written, scores highly on clinical significance, has important contributions to the state of the art, and presents a balanced reporting of results.	"1) The literature review is limited. There are a number of point-cloud deep learning methods [1], which are originally designed for the object detection from 3D point cloud, should can be directly applied for the task of this paper. For instance, VoxelNet [2] and PointRCNN [3] should be mentioned in the Introduction and compared in the Experiments.
2) The detection accuracy of this method is relatively low. The landmark localization error can be more than 10mm as reported in the Experiments section, such large errors should be not clinically satisfied.

237	Graph Emotion Decoding from Visually Evoked Neural Responses	"The data they used for the fMRI was obtained from a small number of participants to represent the objective emotions. The results may be affected by the subjective emotions of the participants. The reviewer recommends performing an analysis using more fMRI data to show the novelty and its reproducibility.
Additionally, as this method uses embedding of the emotions and brain regions, it would be better to interpret the results from the brain regions. Such as explaining the meaningful regions for each corresponding emotion."	The prediction results are better than some state-of-the-arts methods, but the network architecture are much simpler than the methods they are comparing.	"The idea seems interesting to exploit relationships between emotions and brain regions.
The embedding propagation approach is interesting."
238	Graph-based Compression of Incomplete 3D Photoacoustic Data	Based on the current presentation of the significance of this paper and the experimental results, I give my recommendation.	I believe the premise for the undersampling in image domain is either incorrect or not well explained.	The rating reflects innovation of the approach for 3D PA compression.
239	Greedy Optimization of Electrode Arrangement for Epiretinal Prostheses	It's a well-written, interesting study with moderate weakness as described above.	While the paper is well written, the methods are reasonable and the numarical results are valuable, I strongly beleive that MICCAI is not the right community for publishing this work at.	The work itself seems to be good and well done, but it suffers from inconsistencies, missing reference to other basic work, negligencies and cold be improved in the visual presentation of results.
240	Hand Hygiene Quality Assessment using Image-to-Image Translation	I think the work described a novel application and would contributes an interesting topic of research to the conference.	I think it could be quite interesting paper from the application point of view, but the description and validation of the methods is rather weak I would say.	The paper proposes an innovative application of NN to a medical analysis task. However, the analysis of the computational models and discussion of the biases and ethical considerations with respect to the dataset is very limited, given the proposed task.
241	Harnessing Deep Bladder Tumor Segmentation with Logical Clinical Knowledge	It is instructive to integrate clinical logic rules into segmentation tasks using GNN,so I vote to accept.	The method is novel and provides an original way to use clinical data. The paper and the figures are clear. The authors provide comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.	I found a novelty if he is the first to create it with perfect organization.
242	Hierarchical Brain Networks Decomposition via Prior Knowledge Guided Deep Belief Network	This work proposed a novel method to incorporate prior knowledge to DBN for hierarchical brain network decomposition. Sufficient experiments suggest the proposed method can converge faster than the traditional DBN models. It is a novel method for fMRI analysis field. However, there are still a few unclear descriptions and typo errors which need to be further improved.	The advantage of the framework is not very clear to me.	This work propose a novel prior knowledge guided DBN (PKG-DBN) model hierarchical brain network decomposition. This is the first supervised hierarchical FBN identification method as far as I know. It is important to fMRI analysis field.
243	Histogram-based unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image classification	Great idea and results to back it up.	Many details are lost.	The simple, effective and general method for medical image domain adaptation are the key facts.
244	How Much to Aggregate: Learning Adaptive Node-wise Scales on Graphs for Brain Networks	The novelty of the idea is acceptable but not outstanding, the technical realization of the work is scrupulous but the written elaborate is not made with the same attention. The final results are tepid (they might be some tuning or not really significantly different from GraphHeat). It might be a more interesting case for generative problems (e.g. Graph-GANs rather than just classification).	"The method part.
I will raise the score if the author can address my concerns."	The novelty of the adaptive scales for GNN aggregation. Also, this idea is generic and not restricted to brain networks.
245	Hybrid Graph Transformer for Tissue Microstructure Estimation with Undersampled Diffusion MRI Data	The proposed work is claimed to be the first one on using transformers for tissue microstructure estimation using diffusion MRI and shows better results than several state-of-the-art methods.	I believe that this work proposes a novel method, and its effectiveness has been properly demonstrated. Although there are some minor issues, I recommend acceptance.	The paper and underlying work are skillfully executed and a useful addition to the literature.
246	Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Transformer Network for Predicting Ischemic Stroke Lesion Outcomes from 4D CT Perfusion Imaging	"The proposed work has technical novelty. The hybrid CNN-Transformer and application to AIS from CTP raw images are novelties. However, the evaluation raises concerns: 1) the data is not public, 2) results may be overly optimistic due to 10-fold cross-validation, 3) the authors crop the brain hemisphere of interest before analysis.
Still, the MICCAI community could benefit from this work."	The usage of transformer in this application is somewhat novel with outperforming results, although I still suggest to justify the choice of transformer over ConvLSTM and ConvGRU.	I would like to reject this paper due to its limited novelty of the method and insufficient experiments.
247	Ideal Midsagittal Plane Detection using Deep Hough Plane Network for Brain Surgical Planning	Certainly interesting paper with nice methodological contribution that could be relevant for other applications. Unfortunately, reproducibility is rather moderate. It is less transparent why improved results over state of the art are achieved.	"The paper is logical and precise, and the research content has certain clinical value.
It has some bright spots, and really improves the effectiveness of the work in this task area.
But there are also some problems such as unclear description, lack of explanation and inadequate experiment."	I would recommend it weak accept as the midline shift estimate is not done.  With the estimation of midline shift I would recommend it strong accept.
248	Identification of vascular cognitive impairment in adult moyamoya disease via integrated graph convolutional network	There are some unclear parts in the methodology section, and the explanations to the experimental results are also missing. The rest of the paper seem to be OK to me, there are some contribution and novelties in this paper but are not quite significant to me.	The theoretical novelty of the paper is limited. The experiment strategy is not rigorous.	The paper is novel in method, clearly organized and full of results.
249	Identify Consistent Imaging Genomic Biomarkers for Characterizing the Survival-associated Interactions between Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes and Tumors	It seems to be the first method that combines TILs information with genomic data for breast cancer using WSIs.	Good and interesting paper	"Fusing imaging features with the genomic features by an attention mechanism is a novel part of this work.
The proposed approach is well motivated. Experiments are carefully done. Multiple neural networks such as U++, graph attention network, concrete autoencoder, and co-expression network, are used to process and combine imaging and genomic data. For that it became an end-to-end deep learning based framework.
Analysis of the results are clearly mentioned. Comparisons with existing approaches are done."
250	Identifying and Combating Bias in Segmentation Networks by leveraging multiple resolutions	Experiments and analysis have been done well.	Overall, i've found the paper and the topic very interesting and i think deserves to be discussed during the conference. However the lack of information on methodology and most importantly the choice of some experiments could be improved. I understand though the limited space.	The main reason for recommending this paper is that this application of existing bias measurement methods to scale-invariant models, and models trained with scale augmentation provides an interesting way of looking at systemic errors. Using volumetric bias to evaluate generalizability and awareness of systemic errors will vastly improve confidence in how generalizable a given model is.
251	Identifying Phenotypic Concepts Discriminating Molecular Breast Cancer Sub-Types	The key contribution is the extraction of phenotypic concepts shared across multiple examples. This enables the investigation of associations between top- scoring concepts and shared or discriminating features among molecular sub- types. Therefore the proposed method can identify clinically relevant features in imaging data.	The major factor that backs up my decision of acceptance, is the efforts of trying to set up connection between phenotypic and molecular both visually and heuristically, which might agree with human experts in the future work.	I thank the authors for this work, as it is interesting and well presented. What prevents me from accepting is the limited novelty, that seems mostly incremental.
252	Implicit Neural Representations for Generative Modeling of Living Cell Shapes	The proposed method is novel and effective in spatio-temporal cell representation ad synthesis.	The paper is well-written, the method is creative, and the results are compelling.	The paper makes a relatively modest technical contribution and the evaluation could be stronger. These factors are balanced against the inclusion of time as a dimension, which is an interesting contribution.
253	Implicit Neural Representations for Medical Imaging Segmentation	"The contribution of the paper is not clear.
The important reference discussion is missing."	The novelty is limited. The motivation isn't sufficient and reasonable.	Overall, this paper is well-written and easy to follow. The study is well-motivated by a practical problem and the proposed solution is also novel and effective. However, I still have some concerns regarding the inference efficiency of the proposed method and the small size of the testing set (see main weakness list), which should be well addressed before I can suggest the acceptance of this paper.
254	Improved Domain Generalization for Cell Detection in Histopathology Images via Test-Time Stain Augmentation	As described in the weakness, the idea of test-time augmentation is not novel (the method is mostly same) and the effectiveness of the combination of the stain mix-up and the test-time ensemble was not well evaluated. Therefore, my rating tends to 'reject'.	"The strong and weak factors for this decision are:

Simplicity, flexibility and performance as discussed in the ""strengths""
The limited application, and limited analysis. Certain aspects are not clear due to the limited analysis (see ""weaknesses"")"	"This paper is concerned with development of stain normalization method aimed for improving performance of cell counting in histopathology images, whereat tr
training set and target set do not come from the same staining protocol. The authors adopt test-time stain augmentation approach to domain generalization problem. Thus, proposed  stain normalization method is not required to be trained, i.e. the generation of source-target domain mixtures is executed at a test time only. Furthermore, source domain images can be preselected including the case with one source image only. That also can resolve the privacy issue if it exists. Moreover, another important strength is that proposed test-time concept is agnostic on detection model as long as it  produces bounded boxes and confidence. The outlined arguments outweight the potential weakness of proposed method related to a priori (arbitrarily ?) defined hyperparameter of number of detected cells with high confidence ratio."
255	Improving Trustworthiness of AI Disease Severity Rating in Medical Imaging with Ordinal Conformal Prediction Sets	I think this is a well-written and solid experimentation over all.	The authors stated that the training and evaluation code will be made available.	Mainly, inappropriate language and missing experimental details
256	Incorporating intratumoral heterogeneity into weakly-supervised deep learning models via variance pooling	The manuscript is well written and organized and contains novel elements.	"The idea of capturing the intratumoral heterogeneity information is novel and interesting in pathology image analysis.
Experiments with open-sourced code (authors stated they will make code publicly available) and public datasets are reproducible.
The experimental results demonstrate that incorporating the proposed module to MIL frameworks improves survival prediction performance."	The paper has some novelty, however it needs to address some questions described above.
257	INSightR-Net: Interpretable Neural Network for Regression using Similarity-based Comparisons to Prototypical Examples	The work presented has considerable novelty, and is worth discussing at MICCAI, as it addresses one of the major challenges for the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis in the clinics (i.e., interpretability).	The topic and idea is interesting. However, the choice of baselines and datasets needs more consideration.	Prototype is an intersting concept that can be extended to other medical application. Although a deeper investingation could be conducted to better highlight the benefits of such method.
258	InsMix: Towards Realistic Generative Data Augmentation for Nuclei Instance Segmentation	The method is clearly superior to prior art, interesting new ideas are proposed	Overall, well structured and well presented idea, providing novel insight to image augmentation.	An augmentation method based on Copy-Paste with some unique improvements which were especially designed for nuclei segmentation problem.
259	Instrument-tissue Interaction Quintuple Detection in Surgery Videos	See main weaknesses.	"The proposed method extends the state-of-the-art models of representing instrument-tissue interaction as triplets to quintuples adding localization. The stated contribution STAL is a modification of the commonly used spatio-temporal attention module (STAM) but aggregates spatial and temporal information of the ROIs instead.
Although a graph-based quintuple prediction layer (GQPL) to infer the relationship between instruments and tissues is proposed as contribution, the authors do not address the state of the art models in generic object-object graph representations, and also the tool-tissue interaction graph representations in surgical domain, such as the somewhat recent work (2021) by Islam et al. titled STAN: Spatio-Temporal Attention Network for Next Location Recommendation.
It should be clarified that a similar approach was proposed by some earlier works in the surgical domain, and the authors should distinguish their approach in comparison to these works."	The paper is well written and good to follow. There has been an evaluation on real data and an ablation study. However, the results could be better to state-of-the-art, and it is not clear to me how the improved results affect the application. The dataset is limited in my opinion.
260	Interaction-Oriented Feature Decomposition for Medical Image Lesion Detection	The whole idea is novel and each module design makes sense.	"The method has some novelty. However, the paper writing needs improvement. There are inconsistency between the Reproducibility Checklist and the paper. 
The proposed algorithm should be compared with some existing lesion detection / classification methods, instead of only general object detection baselines."	The proposed method introduced two new modules with good motivation and simple formulation. It is also validated on two lesion datasets. Despite some minor concerns, this paper deserves to be accepted.
261	Interpretable differential diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia	The approach that the authors use is unique even though the models that are used within their network have been used. The authors are able to articulate, not just the technical aspects, but also the clinical aspects of the problem. This seems like a tool that can be used in conjunction to approaches currently used in the clinic for deciding treatment methods.	The contribution is not very novel, it is missing several details of the implemented classifiers and there may be a bias for using different databases without giving details of the images or equipment.	"The paper is well written and the experiments are well designed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed classification method. However, there's not too much innovation in the proposed method. 
Good results may be leaded by the cohort bias, How to exclude the cohort bias among datasets should be considered."
262	Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Connectome-Based Brain Disorder Analysis	This work proposed a good method and conducted interpretable biomarkers for different diseases.	strong paper with some weaknesses that lower enthusiasm	The proposed brain network-oriented GNN is novel, the use of a masking matrix to improve the model's robustness and interpretability is an interesting idea. Evaluations on three different brain imaging datasets are solid.
263	Interpretable Modeling and Reduction of Unknown Errors in Mechanistic Operators	I think the method is very interesting. However I think the presentation could be improved to make a much stronger paper. The differences between the previous DAECGI model are not obvious so it is difficult to assess the novelty of the proposed method, as these methods are closely related. Some of the training details are hard to infer from the exposition in the paper. Furthermore, the presented results could be strengthened by adding more interpretable figures and descriptions. In addition I think some of the paper organization, especially with regard to the SOM procedure, could be improved. For these reasons, I would recommend that the paper be rejected so that the authors might strengthen it and resubmit an improved and stronger version.	A new model was proposed, but there are no solid results to support the superior of the model.	This paper addressed an important topic in electrocardiogram. The method bears some novelty and is preliminarily validated.
264	Interpretable signature of consciousness in resting-state functional network brain activity	limited sample size	The novelty and application value in clinical corhort are the major factors.	The paper introduces a novel framework for understanding connectivity patterns in different levels of consciousness. It does a great job of thoroughly explaining the problem and explaining the approach taken to solve the problem. The method is reproducible.
265	Intervention & Interaction Federated Abnormality Detection with Noisy Clients	It is very well written paper and novelty of the work is explained very well.	"The paper proposes a novel FL framework for  the applications of computer aided diagnosis and specifically designs the strategies to solve the issue of FL.
The framework is reasonably designed and the results are also promising."	I liked reading this paper as it nicely establishes motivation, provides the required background and method details. While some assumptions may be weak or unclear, generally the proposed approach can encourage broader discussion and innovation on an important problem for the MICCAI community (learning from data while respecting data privacy and heterogeneity).
266	Intra-class Contrastive Learning Improves Computer Aided Diagnosis of Breast Cancer in Mammography	Well written paper. Good application extenstion of contrastive learning with thorough experiments to back up their hypothesis.	"Novelty
Performance
Dataset description
Consideration of domain knowledge"	The claims are substantiated with the provided results. The experimentation seems to be proper.
267	Invertible Sharpening Network for MRI Reconstruction Enhancement	"Even though the experiments showed interesting aspects with the proposed method, the overall opinion is ""weak reject"" because of the mentioned weaknesses and execution of the idea."	The motivation of this work is clear, the method adopted is intuitive, and the experimental verification is sufficient, so I recommend to accept.	It is a novel paper with extensive experiments. While the quantitative results is not superior, the presentation, analysis and discussion worth presenting in the conference.
268	Is a PET all you need? A multi-modal study for Alzheimer's disease using 3D CNNs	The theoretical novelty is very limited and the experiment is not innovative enough. The experimental results from Table 2 (CN vs. MCI vs. AD) cannot completely conclude that a single-modality network using FDG-PET performs best.	"The paper proposed an interesting framework and highlight the need for futur paper to justify the fusion of sMRI and PET data. 
Paper is well-written and hypothesis are clearly stated, tested, and discussed."	The findings are interesting, but more validations should be conducted on more datasets.
269	iSegFormer: Interactive Segmentation via Transformers with Application to 3D Knee MR Images	Obtains good results in 2D segmentation but unconvincing in 3D segmentation.	The weaknesses were relatively few, mainly related to the under-explanation of specific training details. I think this under-explanation was likely the product of trying to fit their work into the page constraint, and I don't doubt that their results could be reproduced if these method details were elaborated on. Meanwhile, the novelty of their methods/architecture and demonstration of superior results (state-of-the-art using an architecture not used in this style of task) seem to have the potential to move the field forward.	I think this is an interesting approach but I'd like to see a bit more in the Discussion about envisioned clinical utility.
270	Joint Class-Affinity Loss Correction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation with Noisy Labels	"The paper overall is easy to understand and the results also look good. However, some important details (especially for the affinity computation) are not clearly presented and the ablative experiment are not through, making it hard to evaluate the effectiveness of some essential designs. Thus, in the current stage, I will recommend the paper  ""weak reject""."	"Overall I think the proposed method is novel, in terms of motivation and method design. The proposed method is demonstrated to be more effective on one medical image dataset (although the number of datasets used is limited). However, this paper still lacks some critical ablation studies to justify its technical contributions.
The major factors I take into account for scoring: novelty and experimental evaluation."	The proposed method is novel and has been indicated to be effective under various types of noise labels.
271	Joint Graph Convolution for Analyzing Brain Structural and Functional Connectome	The method is interesting but the experimental settings need some improvement.	The author should prove that the coupling model still works in adult data and make a clear interpretation on the meaning of these task-driven coupling values.	The rationality is not well explained. The experimental result is not good enough to support the advantage of the proposed model.
272	Joint Modeling of Image and Label Statistics for Enhancing Model Generalizability of Medical Image Segmentation	"I am impressed by the solid improvements in generalizability compared to methods which are otherwise the goto techniques in the field. While I have problems following all details of the technique, it appears the auth
ors have had a good idea that is worth publishing."	Highly relevant to the community and a seemingly new model, thoroughly evaluated with convincing results.	"I believe the proposed method is a novel approach and addresses an important challenge in the medical image segmentation field.
The theoretical analysis of the framework design seems to be relatively thorough. Even though some training details are missing, the overall quality of the paper is good."
273	Joint Prediction of Meningioma Grade and Brain Invasion via Task-Aware Contrastive Learning	This is a strong paper and although I listed a number of weaknesses, the strengths greatly outweigh the weakness I have identified. The weaknesses are listed mostly a points that could be addressed to provide a journal paper.	The authors present a novel approach for multi-task learning and perform appropriate ablation and baseline experiments. Their results demonstrate overall improved performance, especially in the multi-task setting. There are some instances where their methodology could be further explained or justified, which should be easily amendable. The lack of a validation split may have implications on the generalizability of their results and subsequent performance on independent datasets. However, this is be expected to be uniform across all ablation experiments and baselines.	The proposed approach is novel and elegant and yet simple to implement. Yet the validation is too weak to be completely convincing. The benefit of adding task-common features and contrastive losses is not clear.
274	Joint Region-Attention and Multi-Scale Transformer for Microsatellite Instability Detection from Whole Slide Images in Gastrointestinal Cancer	Reasonable method with some novelty and performance gain. Some details are missing but can be fixed.	I recommend acceptance of the paper given the novelty of the method, the convincing results and the proper explanations in the text. The weaknesses I see are mainly regarding to lack of details in some sections so I see way more strenghts than weaknesses and I think the paper adds value to the MICCAI community.	Main strengths of the paper.
275	Kernel Attention Transformer (KAT) for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Classification	"1) It handles the spatial relationship between patch-level  and WSI-level  information very well.
2) And, this paper implements hierarchical context information of the local regions in an innovative way.
I vote for weak accept because the authors not implement their method on mainstream dataset like Camelyon16."	Though this paper has novel kernel attention transformer, motivations are not very clear and presented in the paper. The authors should emphasize why their framework could be very suitable for WSI classification. Otherwise, it just used a fancy technique. Experiments cannot support the claims that the proposed model is more effective and efficient than baseline models as we can see in some cases the proposed KAT cannot perform better than TransMIL or Nystromformer.	The paper is really well written, the results are strong and the discussion about other methods demonstrates an awareness and respect for the latest advances in the field. Although there is little in the way of architectural or algorithmic details, this is clearly a strong piece of work that deserves a place at MICCAI.
276	Key-frame Guided Network for Thyroid Nodule Recognition using Ultrasound Videos	The paper is well-written, easy to follow and have practical value. The ablation experiments are solid.	The manuscript propose a  novel framework for thyroid nodule detection in US videos that can act as a CAD in the clinical settings. However, more evaluation and adjustement is necessary.	The paper presents limited innovation as compared with paper [2], by using a similar attention module and changing the imaging method from CEUS to B-scan US.
277	Knowledge Distillation to Ensemble Global and Interpretable Prototype-based Mammogram Classification Models	In my opinion this is an excellent work and I do not have any suggestion for improvement. The improvement of ProtoPNet is very welcomed.	This paper is well-written and easy to read. The motivaion and method are clearly demonstrated. The experimental results can support the method.	The paper is of high quality in writing and reasoning.
278	Landmark-free Statistical Shape Modeling via Neural Flow Deformations	The experiment results may be satisfying although the experiment is not sufficient.	Albeit its complexity and the lack of implementation details, the introduced shape space is of high interest for the community.	The apllication to shape modeling is interesting. It is difficult to judge novelty beacuse of the shortness of the paper, but the proposal is interesting. I think the paper would turn into to a good topic for discussion in the conference.
279	Layer Ensembles: A Single-Pass Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Learning for Segmentation	The idea of using layer ensemble for uncertainty qualification is interesting.	Although some comparisons are missing, i believe that the work as is, is very insightful for the MICCAI community for future research direction in this relevant field of uncertainty estimation.	The justification of using low level feature to determine uncertainty is the major factor that impacts the overall score.
280	Learn to Ignore: Domain Adaptation for Multi-Site MRI Analysis	the authors show impressive results on the target domain, while keeping the performance on the source domain high. The method is simple and could possibly be useful for other tasks, e.g. image segmentation.	Overall, this domain adaptation paper cannot validate its claim by training on both source and target domains in the experiment. And apparently the authors still compare their method with the baseline methods on the target domain.	Appropriate model design. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets.
281	Learning Incrementally to Segment Multiple Organs in a CT Image	The clarity of the presentation, which reduces the reproducibility of the method, and the unclear advantage of using the memory module motivate my decision of weakly rejecting the paper. That said, the work has merit and should be re-submitted once it gets sufficiently revised.	The general motivation drives its novelty. The proposed method has demonstrates its effectiveness. Thus, I would recommend accepting this paper.	"Strong innovation dealing with how to build a single multi-organ segmentation model from partially labelled, sequentially constructed datasets
Incremental learning applied for the first time to multiple organ segmentation"
282	Learning iterative optimisation for deformable image registration of lung CT with recurrent convolutional networks	See above.	Two major issues are clarity in the presentation and issues in experimental results.	The paper presents an interesting approach. Although, it is hard to see the impact and application in its current form.
283	Learning Robust Representation for Joint Grading of Ophthalmic Diseases via Adaptive Curriculum and Feature Disentanglement	"Quality of the proposal: the method is well presented and described and offers the right insights to the task at hand.
Experimental evaluation: well conducted and presented. Strong results in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset experiments.
Conclusions: supported by the presentation and results."	"the methods are strong
the results and experiments are strong
the paper is well written"	The method is quiet novel, and experiments does proved the authors design of network and loss functions. The paper is well written and easy to follow
284	Learning self-calibrated optic disc and cup segmentation from multi-rater annotations	"The proposal is sound and the explication is in detail with theoretical proof.
The evaluation method is very robust and the result is satisfying.
The paper is quietly well organized."	The multi-rater consensus challenge is ubiquitous in any clinically relevant algorithm development, the method is novel and interesting and experiments are convincing, despite minor concerns about complexity and practicality of the proposed method.	"The idea of using self-fusion labels and SSIM loss for the combined segmentation  is interesting. However, the paper has multiple grammar errors and is difficult to follow.
There are incorrect statements and the algorithm evaluation has several issues (see details in the comments)."
285	Learning shape distributions from large databases of healthy organs: applications to zero-shot and few-shot abnormal pancreas detection	The paper doesn't have significant novelty but it has some contribution for the field, furthermore, the clarity and organization of the paper is not bad.	The topic is quite interesting, however the results are not very solid.	The paper clearly stands out from other papers that I usually see during MICCAI review or on MICCAI. Given the number of experiments and details reported, it rather feels like reading a journal paper. Another strong asset is originality. Rather than proposing yet-another-deep-learning-tweak, the authors suggest a relatively novel approach that might boost additional research. The main weakness is of course the limited reproducibility due to in-house data and code.
286	Learning towards Synchronous Network Memorizability and Generalizability for Continual Segmentation across Multiple Sites	There are some flaws with the lack of reference to FL and subsequent comparison, and some of the motivations are ill-founded, but it is technically a good paper where merits slightly weigh over weakness.	The paper still has values and is well-written overall. The authors try to make a connection between the CL and DG methods, but given the proposed method handles a specific family of DG methods (meta-learning with pseudo-train/test splits), the argument sounds a little weak.	"The authors developed a well organised and clear written study. They organise a well case study with an appropriate way of training, validation and testing hypotheses and datasets involved. The authors compare their learning method with state of the art approaches. Their method outperforms the existing learning approaches.
This justified a well organised and delivered study."
287	Learning Tumor-Induced Deformations to Improve Tumor-Bearing Brain MR Segmentation	It's a good problem and the method is well-formulated and looks as if it should work, but the lack of suitable baselines in the experimental results is concerning.	"There is no validation using real data.
Technical novelty is very limited. The proposed point-cloud deep learning network has already been used in the literature."	The method proves an improvement over the traditional atlas-based segmentation. I like the idea of combining deep-learning and modeling approaches. The regression network on its own is well formulated.
288	Learning Underrepresented Classes from Decentralized Partially Labeled Medical Images	The topic is novel, The method looks novel but I think some important but detailed information is missed.	The study overall is interesting. Some points need more explanation to help readers better understand the paper.	As shown in the weaknesses.
289	Learning with Context Encoding for Single-Stage Cranial Bone Labeling and Landmark Localization	The paper appears to be interesting and could potentially be beneficial to the community	It is unclear what are challenges of automatic skull bone segmentation and landmark detection from cranial CT images. Compared with related works (i.e., Ref. 14, 18, 19, 20), the task of this paper is less than difficult, as the skull structure is generally easy to extract from CT images and the number of localized landmarks reported in this paper is very limited. Besides, only a few of relevant methods were tested for this relatively simple task.	"The single-step joint prediction of segmentation and landmarks architecture with contextual encoding mechanism proposed by the paper is highly applicable in many medical imaging tasks.
At the same time, the paper explained the novel mechanism with clarity."
290	Learning-based and unrolled motion-compensated reconstruction for cardiac MR CINE imaging	This is a very interesting approach with good results	This paper is well constructed with improved results and a good discussion.	The proposed work solves a very relevant clinical problem by following a well thought out framework. Authors have clearly stated the weaknesses of the method.
291	Learning-based US-MR Liver Image Registration with Spatial Priors	Please see the described weaknesses and detailed comments.	The paper shows impressive results on a difficult problem.	The US-MR liver image registration workflow presents sufficient amount of novelty. The application has significant clinical value. In-vivo validation and assessment of the performances are provided.
292	Lesion Guided Explainable Few Weak-shot Medical Report Generation	This article may be innovative enough, but it has poor writing quality and insufficient experiments.	The few weak-shot setting is interesting. It provide an potential solution for smooth evolution of the machine learning system that requires expensive annotations.	Novel approach but needs demonstration between two substantially different classes.
293	Lesion-Aware Contrastive Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Images Analysis	There is some novelty in the method design, especially for the member back queue part. The experiment is solid and proves the effectiveness of this method.	"The proposed method is well-motivated but not well-explained.
There are some settings are unclear and more details should be provided."	Novel class-aware contrastive learning framework, insufficient/unfair method comparison.
294	Lesion-aware Dynamic Kernel for Polyp Segmentation	This is a technically good and novel paper. It does need some clarification and also additional clinical context for improvement with potential ref to use in video.	This manuscript is ready for the acceptance of MICCAI. It has detailed methodology, enough experiments and competitive performance. I vote for 'strong accept' in first round.	There are several details missing and the manuscripts needs to be polished further.
295	Less is More: Adaptive Curriculum Learning for Thyroid Nodule Diagnosis	The motivation of this paper is innovative and attractive.	For the conceptual innovation, novel architecture and dataset	"The new dataset which contains a large amount of samples and the corresponding biopsy labels.
The training algorithm is clear and this guarantees the reproducibility.
The better performances obtained by this paper."
296	Leveraging Labeling Representations in Uncertainty-based Semi-supervised Segmentation	The idea of using DEA to reconstruct a segmentation mask for the current non-ideal prediction and estimating uncertainty directly from the pixel-wise difference between the reconstructed segmentation mask and the estimated mask by the student model is novel. This uncertainty estimation only needs one inference stage, thus reducing the computational cost. The experiments on the LA dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. However, more experiments and deeper analysis would make the paper more convincing.	This paper proposes a labeling representation-based uncertainty estimation algorithm for semi-supervised segmentation. It obtains better performance than SOTAs on left atrium segmentation from 3D MR volumes in two different settings.	Evenly this is a well-presented work, its current motivation is not strong. I can't see the necessity of 'single inference'. My another major concern is the lacking of experimental comprisons.
297	LIDP: A Lung Image Dataset with Pathological Information for Lung Cancer Screening	"I rate the paper as ""Strong accept"" assuming that the database is going to be made publicly available. If that is not the case, I would rate it as weak reject.
As stated above, the main contribution of the paper is the very strong dataset that the authors have generated by using the gold standard pathology information. This could be a landmark database for pulmonary nodule classification AI models."	The paper introduces a much needed pathology-based cancer ground truth to the research community. This is a great step in enhancing both training, understanding, and evaluation among future papers. Focusing on the dataset preparation itself would greatly strengthen the paper. As it is, it attempts to cover too many topics with too little detail.	"This paper presents good arguments for the presented dataset (LIDP) and identifies important weaknesses in the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Further testing and more details on these tests are needed to assess the quality of the new data, but it seems to have great potential and covers the gaps in the existing benchmark dataset.
However, I am not entirely confident that the introduction of new datasets is appropriate for MICCAI."
298	LifeLonger: A Benchmark for Continual Disease Classification	While task and class incremental learning are clearly defined and evaluated sufficiently, the motivation and evaluation of cross-domain incremental learning remains unclear. In addition more discussion on the results in all continual learning scenarios would be needed for accepting the paper.	Although a benchmark for continual learning methods for medical image classification is interesting and important for the field, the definition of the cross-domain incremental learning setting is not clinically relevant.	While I am unsure about how transferable MedMNIST is as a benchmark for continual medical image classification, establishing the three proposed settings as a first/complementary way to evaluate continual learning methods would help standardize the evaluation in the medical domain. However, metrics should follow existing conventions and include forwards transfer.
299	LiftReg: Limited Angle 2D/3D Deformable Registration	Overall this paper has everything I look for in a good MICCAI paper: Important application, technical novelty, and most importantly good experimental design and results showing improvement over prior published methods.	This work provides a new perspective on deformable 2D-3D registration using artificial intelligence. The developed network architecture and the back-projection process is unique and of value for the community. No evaluation of real clinical data (specifically 2D X-rays) is provided.	The overall study design lacks support, especially on using the PCA-based DVF model across the full population. The lift3D module also lacks justification.
300	Light-weight spatio-temporal graphs for segmentation and ejection fraction prediction in cardiac ultrasound	Please see the weaknesses. My main concerns are lack of the ablation study and significance of results.	Its a good paper, with a really nice formulation for the keypoints regression. However, the keypoints are hard to come by in real life - at least the way I'm understanding them - maybe wrong about it.	I like the fact that their model has potential to be used and deployed in clinical practise due to its high computational speed. 2D echocardiography is the main imaging modality in cardiology, and one of its drawbacks is the difficulty in its quantification. Therefore I think that this contribution is an important step towards overcome that issue. As stated by the authors in their text, the fact that a 2D contour of the endocardium is provided as output can be useful for many other applications.
301	Local Attention Graph-based Transformer for Multi-target Genetic Alteration Prediction	"The first attempt to predict microsatellite instability or tumor mutational burden with genetic alterations.
The first transformer-based approach for mutation prediction."	The paper addresses important issues in applying multiple instance learning to prediction tasks in whole slide images.	Main strengths of the paper.
302	Local Graph Fusion of Multi-View MR Images for Knee Osteoarthritis Diagnosis	The paper is well organized and propose a novel framework for multi-view MR image fusion to diagnose knee OA. The experimental results are the best.	"Effectiveness and some possible innovations of method for the knee OA problem.
But the article lacks discussion and comparison with high similarity articles, which is a big flaw."	The presented approach is novel and it is of community interest as multi-contrast MR images are used for diagnosis. Comparative and ablation studies are performed and explained in great detail.
303	Localizing the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve via Ultrasound with a Bayesian Shape Framework	The novelty of the proposed method and the experiments are sufficient for weak accept.	This paper puts forward a method which could solve a practical clinical problem. The method's performance is good. The study design is impressive: lots of patients were involved; the new method is compared with many current methods; an ablation study shows that both local information and global context contributed to the good performance; visualization of the result is convincing.	The proposed method is reasonable and novel. However I am not convinced by the results, especially the baseline models' performance.
304	Local-Region and Cross-Dataset Contrastive Learning for Retinal Vessel Segmentation	Although deep learning segmentation network methods are extensively studied for vessel segmentation, the authors present a novel way to further improve the segmentation results by contrastive learning approaches.	"The algorithm proposed in the paper is mostly adapted from [1], which however is not cited in the paper. It is necessary to clarify the technical contributions of the paper against [1], before it can be accepted.
[1] Exploring Cross-Image Pixel Contrast for Semantic Segmentation. ICCV 21."	The methodology motivates well, but the paper presentation needs to be objective and application-motivated, which requires a certain revision. Some other points also need clarification, summarised in the weakness and comments.
305	Longitudinal Infant Functional Connectivity Prediction via Conditional Intensive Triplet Network	The presented work is sufficiently rigorous, transparent and engaging to be presented in a conference. It shows potential usage given further studies of its performance.	The authors make an important and explainable network model for the challenging task of FC maturation prediction at individual level. This topic is valuable and may raise the general interests in both clinical field and fundamental research field.	The major problem of this paper is that method parts is not clear. More detail should be give, otherwise it's hard to follow.  With such complicated designed network, ablation study is necessary.
306	Long-tailed Multi-label Retinal Diseases Recognition via Relational Learning and Knowledge Distillation	Please see the strengths and weaknesses.	The framework uses lesion segmentation and grading information from subjects with diabetic retinopathy to perform an initial classification task. Then, the dataset is split into several subsets to train different teachers and to apply attention mechanisms, then multiple teacher-student is distilled. The authors tested the proposed method with two datasets with the performance metrics and class activation maps.	This paper is well-written and easy to read. The motivaion and method are clearly demonstrated. However, there lacks of some crucial comparisons, such as comparison between the proposed attention and existing CBAM. Besides, the performance is not superior to existing CCT-Net.
307	Low-Dose CT Reconstruction via Dual-Domain Learning and Controllable Modulation	There are two obvious problems. First, the clinical value of the proposed strategy is not clear. Second, the proposed method is not reasonable, and experiments do not provide enough evidence that the fMRI feature has hints for predicting gaze patterns. And its improvement over DP-ResNet is not significant in some cases.	Very nice approach that is novel. Good comparison with different dataset. Still the improvement with respect to state-of-the-art is not very significant	The authors are working on an old topic of low-dose CT imaging. Network designed in this manuscript is not new as the components within the network has been applied previously. Results are not impressive.
308	Low-Resource Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Cross-Modality Nucleus Detection	This is a well-conducted research work with good results. It proposes an improvement for unsupervised domain adaptation with GANs when the target training data is limited. However, its novelty is rather limited; a new data augmentation module is integrated to a GAN network. Moreover, it only addresses the low-resource case of the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). It is very likely that the proposed method won't be needed in the case of sufficiently big target training data. Thus, the proposed method does not offer a general improvement to GANs for UDA, although it presents an effective solution to GANs for UDA with limited target training data. It should also be noted that data augmentation techniques have been numerously proved to be an efficient way to efficiently train deep neural networks on small datasets. This paper mainly repeats known contributions of data augmentation and then proposes a new data augmentation module, which is a case-specific solution.	I like the idea presented in the paper and the approach followed by the authors. I think they need to work more on graphically show their contributions and technical approaches, as well as better introduce the motivation and what is the specific problem for which they propose this solution.	"This is a very strong submission, with advanced methodology, clear presentation and convincing validation. 
In particular, the authors have introduced several methodological improvements including task-specific model for supporting the source-target discriminator, target consistency constraint and stochastic data augmentation scheme (in both source- and target domains). This allows efficient training under the scenario of low availability of (unlabeled) data in the target domain. The authors have demonstrated the power of their approach by using a single image from the target domain. The results of this experiment were much better compared to the state-of-the-art methods (trained on the same data) and comparable to training directly in the target domain. In addition, the authors perform an ablation study demonstrating, in particular, importance of the introduced stochastic data augmentation step."
309	LSSANet: A Long Short Slice-Aware Network for Pulmonary Nodule Detection	The research of this paper is very valuable and is a hot topic in the field. Although the experimental results are relatively good, the method used in this paper is based on the pre-trained model of the current state-of-the-art method. Papers will not be accepted unless the authors provide code or models to illustrate the reproducibility of the method.	The motivation and paper writing are all good.	
310	MAL: Multi-modal attention learning for tumor diagnosis based on bipartite graph and multiple branches	See my comments above.	"The proposed method was only evaluated on three spine tumor datasets while the author emphasized its general applicability on tumor diagnosis in the title, Abstract and Conclusion.
The experiments are not convincing enough."	The multimodal learning framework seems to be novel for the MRI/CT data. The results in comparison with doctors seem to be good.
311	MaNi: Maximizing Mutual Information for Nuclei Cross-Domain Unsupervised Segmentation	The proposed method is interesting and comprises novel elements. Results are promising. However, some issues should be addressed (see comments).	The overall paper lacks novelty. Important ablation experiments are missing.	I think the novelty in proposing the JSD based adaptation approach and the empirical results outweight the weakness of not evaluating against other types of MI estimators.
312	Mapping in Cycles: Dual-Domain PET-CT Synthesis Framework with Cycle-Consistent Constraints	This paper implemented a PET-to-CT synthesis framework by exploiting both image and sinogram information and constructing bidirectional cycle mapping. The authors have conducted several comparison and ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method and the validity of the key components. However, its disadvantages are also obvious. As mentioned before, the motivation for this article was not stated clearly, since the cost of acquiring abundant PET images for training is much higher than that of CT. In addition, the details of existing CT synthesis methods need to be better described. Another serious problem is that current comparison methods are somewhat outdated and not sufficient to prove the superiority of the proposed method. Finally, the innovation of this paper is not sufficient, since the dual-domain information has been introduced to enhance CT quality before. And the cycle consistent constraint has also been widely used.	The idea is interesting and the experiments partly support the main contributions. It is novel to use dual domain learning in PET to CT transformation and cycle consistent losses help to boost the performance.	Despite focusing on 2D data processing (which is understandable in early development), the proposed method exploited both image domain and projection domain information and achieved significantly improved results. This might potentially make an impact in clinical applications once the method is adapted to 3D volume data processing.
313	Mask Rearranging Data Augmentation for 3D Mitochondria Segmentation	The novelty of the proposed method is clear and the results are promising, although the presentation of the results should be improved and the use of more datasets is recommended.	The investigation of conducting mask rearranging data augmentation is interesting and seems useful. The paper is neat and in principle.	The topic of data augmentation is of interest to the community and the experiment on reduced number of annotations is intriguing. However, there are concerns about incremental novelty on methodology as well as limited experiments and validation.
314	MaxStyle: Adversarial Style Composition for Robust Medical Image Segmentation	The method is innovative, the experiments are robust, the results are promising, and the presentation is clear.	"The idea is interesting to augment style with adversarial learning.
Extensive experiments are conducted to show effectiveness of the proposed method.
The paper is well organized starting from preliminaries to the improved version.
One issue has not been explained in the paper, which makes the result not convincing and needs to be clarified."	The idea of expanding style space with additional noise and search for harder style composition is interesting and somewhat noble. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies shows the superiority and effectiveness of proposed model. Also, the clarity and organization of the paper is good.
315	MCP-Net: Inter-frame Motion Correction with Patlak Regularization for Whole-body Dynamic PET	This work includes a kinetic model to account for tracer kinetics in dynamic PET imaging for data-driven motion correction. It might be an extension of a previous work. By using a computationally simple kinetic model, the authors demonstrated the improvements in the final outcomes. This work has been successful in proving its motivation.	I still have a few concerns about the data aspect of this paper, but the results seem solid (despite being ever so marginally higher than B-ConvLSTM). If the authors can explain the data section better, it would be helpful. It would also alleviate concerns with overfitting.	Making use of tracer kinetics for motion correction is the right direction to address this problem.
316	Measurement-conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Under-sampled Medical Image Reconstruction	The proposed measurement conditioned DDPM for accelerated MRI reconstruction is novel. While there are some limitations and weaknesses of the proposed method, the proposed method demonstrates promising results on the test dataset.	This manuscript is well constructed and the method are well verified by adequate results.	The application of DDPM to undersampled MRI reconstruction is the novel part. However, the paper lacks the comparison with the current methods. It also not clear if DDPM is practically available. e.g. the discussion on the computational time is missing.
317	Mesh-based 3D Motion Tracking in Cardiac MRI using Deep Learning	The paper is innovative and the experimental evaluations are convincing.	This is a well written paper with good experimental setup and validation of a novel  cardiac motion correction method based on deep learning. The authors provide a rigorous set of validation experiments to compare their proposed method to other registration approached and include a strong set of ablation studies to demonstrate their design decisions.	"1) This is an overall interesting work. Very good innovation. Manuscript well written. Has scientific value. The novelty is good enough for a weak accept but not outstandingly impressive.
2) The part of comparison to previous works part is still weak. Not too convincing for me to recommend a strong acceptance."
318	Meta-hallucinator: Towards few-shot cross-modality cardiac image segmentation	The methodology lack clarity, thereby it is difficult to determine how each module of the proposed method works to achieve adaptation under the challenging scenario.	Novel method for an important medical imaging problem.	"the idea is simple and straightforward.
the sufficient experiment to prove the effectiveness of proposed method"
319	MIRST-DM: Multi-Instance RST with Drop-Max Layer for Robust Classification of Breast Cancer	The technical novelty and impressive quantitative results make me to recommend acceptance.	The authors focus on the adversarial example robustness on small-size medical images, and there are some useful works. The authors present a method that is multi-instance robust self-training with a drop-max layer, which is simple yet maybe effective.	The paper is well-written and the results show a clear improvement between the baseline and the proposed approaches. Some aspects of the method like the dropmax layer heuristically perform well but it would be nice to better formulate the selection of the element used by the pooling.
320	Mixed Reality and Deep Learning for External Ventricular Drainage Placement: a Fast and Automatic Workflow for Emergency Treatments	The paper is strong on all aspects but lacks novelty.	Brain shift is an essential issue during the EVD placement. The surgical tool interacts with the brain soft tissue, which will shift due to the external interaction. The target region may move to another position, which will significantly impact the accuracy of the surgery.	Good engineering solution, but lacks of novel technical development and validation is limited.
321	mmFormer: Multimodal Medical Transformer for Incomplete Multimodal Learning of Brain Tumor Segmentation	In general, medical data lacks in information in form of modalities and this is current area of research. The paper presented a new mmFormer architecture which can tackle this issue well.	Absence of implementation details and comparison with ACN in ref[21]. Looking at table 1 in ref [21], the best performance using the mmFormer (77.61, 85.78, 89.64) is marginally better than ACN (77.46, 85.18, 89.22). However, the average performance across the 15 models is slightly better for ACN model (61.21, 77.62, 85.92) compared with mmFormer (59.85, 72.97, 82.94). It would be nice to have justification in terms of model size / usability / generalizability. Not sure if comparison with Table 1 in ref [21] is valid as it is unclear if the splits in ACN were saved and used in this work or if another random splitting was performed!	written. The motivation to use transformer should be cleared presented.
322	Modality-adaptive Feature Interaction for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities	The method has fair novelty with improved performance. The paper is generally well orgnized and clear. However, the validation is not solid.  It seems that the comparsion in Table 1 is not under the same cross-validation slpit, which may result in unfair comparision.  Significance test is missing. Since the proposed method has small improvement in comparision with RFNet, significance test is recomended.	The method proposed in this paper is more intuitive, the experiments are relatively sufficient.	Overall, the paper is very interesting, and the method shows great potential.
323	ModDrop++: A Dynamic Filter Network with Intra-subject Co-training for Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation with Missing Modalities	This paper tried to address a realistic problem in the clinical settings for MS lesion segmentation, however, the solution proposed was trivial and lacked justification. In addition, the experiments were extensive but not well-designed. The information shown by the experimental results did not support the effectiveness of the proposed method.	The proposed framework shows novelty and could be of interest to researchers in the field. Its evaluation could be improved to strengthen the conclusions.	This paper proposes interesting improvements for the problem of missing modalities which is a real problem in medical imaging.
324	Modelling Cycles in Brain Networks with the Hodge Laplacian	The authors do propose some interesting novel ideas. But the motivation is not completely clear at this moment. Also comparing to other topology-based baselines is necessary. I will be happy to improve my scores if the concerns are addressed.	This work presents a novel and useful extension of a relevant analytical method in medical image analysis.	This work proposes a novel theoretically sound approach to identifying 1-cycles in the brain network as a strong feature. This novel approach is proven based on an important theorem in the paper. The synthetic data and real-world data suggest the efficacy of the proposed method to extract 1-cyles in the brain network. This idea can be extended to any graph semantic graph analysis beyond medical image analysis. The paper is also clearly well-written and cohesive in all parts.
325	Momentum Contrastive Voxel-wise Representation Learning for Semi-supervised Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation	Given the results and the general pipeline making overall sense, I would still opt for acceptance, but strongly urge the authors to expand the method section with more details.	The method improves state-of-the-art approaches in cases where only very few labeled images are available. This is a likely scenario in real-world applications. The evaluation of the method is elaborate, and well described. The ablation study covers all building blocks of the method. Overall, the paper is well organized and easy to follow.	The lack of contrastive learning baselines and enough citations for contrastive learning methods to demonstrate the confidence of the proposed idea
326	Morphology-Aware Interactive Keypoint Estimation	"The current rating is based on the following major factors:

This submission tackles an important problem in fixing the errors in automatic keypoint estimation for medical images.
The proposed method has the potential to improve the user correction efficiency.
The discussion and explanations in the experiments are not clear enough.
The discussion of the limitations/future work is not provided."	The proposed algorithm is novel and the targeted use case is of high clinical value. Significant details regarding the network architecture and the training process are currently missing in the paper. Aspects related to the gating network and the morphology-aware loss are not adequately explained.	"The approach of combining interaction with a morphology-based loss is very interesting and seems to guide the network in multiple aspects. I haven't yet come across such an approach for landmark detection (but I am also not fully familiar with the corresponding literature in the CV domain). It is generally well evaluated with multiple reference methods as baselines. Some of the weaknesses (description of the method, missing variance in the results, discussion) can be rectified rather easily, one aspect that I would have liked to see in addition is a user study that confirms the improvements in addition to ""simulated interactions""."
327	Moving from 2D to 3D: volumetric medical image classification for rectal cancer staging	Despite having a few problems, the paper has proved its point through extensive experiements. Even though the performance is not outstanding, the findings in the paper are useful for future work in this direction.	The work contains  an excellent engineering contribution	The idea of this paper is fantastic and the novelties of the method also acceptable.  But some details of the dataset, network architecture and experimental outcome are required more efforts.
328	MRI Reconstruction by Completing Under-sampled K-space Data with Learnable Fourier Interpolation	Its a novel idea that had been investigated on s small dataset. However, comparisons with some state of the art algorithms have also been performed. This work could be further expanded and the authors claims can be validated accordingly.	All in all, the current paper has good motivation but the technical description and intuition needs to be strongly improved as well as the experimental setting. Otherwise, the current version is appreciated with an incremental technical novelty and a limited experimental setting.	The paper overall is good and clinical relevant. The method proposed by the authors has some novelty. However, they is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method to ensure that the reproducibility of the findings of the study (that may be a consequence of the MICCAI paper format).
329	mulEEG: A Multi-View Representation Learning on EEG Signals	The fusion of differnt kinds of features has been widely adopted. It is quite mature strategy that has been used in the field.	Based on experimental results, I suggest weak acceptance.	"Using complementary information to construct positive pairs in contrastive learning for EEG is novel.
The paper is well-written."
330	Multidimensional Hypergraph on Delineated Retinal Features for Pathological Myopia Task.	This work has applications for predicting the degree of PM by utilizing the relationship between different retinal anatomical features using graph learning. However, most of the extracted features used are obtained from machine learning and deep learning methods.	"I see that this work tackled an interesting problem in a novel way. However, with the limitations I mentioned above I rate this paper with ""Weak accept""."	The authors evaluate a novel algorithmic approach on a novel dataset, and show competitive results.  Supporting algorithms were developed and made available to the community.  This is an interesting direction that I think would spur further research.
331	Multi-head Attention-based Masked Sequence Model for Mapping Functional Brain Networks	Because of an interesting application of state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as Transformer, systematic evaluation of the results.	The proposed method is novel and effective. The writting quality and experiments can be improved.	"Poor validation. Again, it should be biased to validate the supervised model with unsupervised models.

Some artifacts are reported as Identified Brain Networks.
In Fig 5(b), the identified network at the 2nd row and 2nd column is an artifact.

There is no consistency in qualitative comparison.
For instance, in Fig. 4, the results are not mapped to the same background images."
332	Multi-institutional Investigation of Model Generalizability for Virtual Contrast-enhanced MRI Synthesis	Novelty, experimental design, result presentation.	The paper is clinically relevant and may interest a lot of scientists. Studying the generalization of deep learning methods is important for facilitate their integration in clinical practice.	"1) Well organised and written paper. Easily Readable, and high reproducibility.
2) Well planning study which answers clearly the initial hypothesis.
3) Clinical contribution and conclusions about generalization.
A very nice study just some minor concerns:
1)Need of statistical analysis about the significance of the testing cohorts so the authors can strengthen the final conclusion about the training in different cohorts and generalization.
2) More details about the institutes and the difference of the cohorts' modalities, resolution quality needed.
3) minor typos (conclusion needs capital C, reference of L1 loss or equation is needed)"
333	Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Contrastive Learning based Feature Comparison with Monomodal Normal Brain Images	It is an interesting method for tumor segmentation that utilizes both multimodal and monomodal data to improve the performance, but there are lacks experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness against the baselines and the existing methods based on the contrastive learning.	The work proposed in the paper is interesting and new. However, there are some weaknesses, such as the evaluation procedure, the setting of just segmenting Whole Tumor that is different from the setting in BraTS and the brain tumor segmentation community, and the imprecise use of the Contrastive Learning concept, when what was used was a non-contrastive learning method (SimSiam). So, despite the interesting work, the Reviewer believes that some changes would be necessary.	This paper proposed an interesting novel idea to improve the segmentation accuracy. The method sound both theoretically and experimentally. It was well described and the experiments are sufficient to justify the model efficacy. Quantification over extensive experiments are done quite well.
334	Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Prospective Personalized Estimation of CT Organ Dose	The weaknesses of this paper rely on the clarity of the presentation but not on the methodology itself. I think it could be easily improved with minor cosmetic changes.	This is a very technical, CT oriented paper that proposes to leverage pseudo multimodality and contrastive learning in an original way that I think would find an audience at MICCAI.	The method seems sound, although some more motivations and ablation studies could better convince the reader about specific design choices. Some notations and missing informations make the paper not very easy to read although it is well written.
335	Multi-Modal Hypergraph Diffusion Network with Dual Prior for Alzheimer Classification	Due to the novelty of the proposed method, the effectiveness of the results, I prefer to accept for the manuscript.	Interesting paper where merits slightly weigh over weakness.	The proposed method seems like a sound extension of jointly learning feature embeddings strategy and hypergraph diffusion module. The idea is novel. Yet hypergraph diffusion module is not clear,  and some typographical and grammatical improvements should be made,
336	Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoders for Medical Vision-and-Language Pre-Training	This is a very nice study that integrates information from chest radiographs and reports for pre-training ViT. The proposed joint pre-training strategy is fairly novel and easy-to-implement, and extensive experiments show the pre-trained model is powerful across many vision-language tasks.	The proposed approach is simple yet effective. The experimental results on three downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of using low-level features for reconstructing the input images. The weakness such as typos and the detailed explanations could be easily modified in the final version.	The method for the medical field is novel, and the clarity and organization of this paper are very good. Besides, the method is evaluated in 3 downstream tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness.
337	Multi-modal Retinal Image Registration Using a Keypoint-Based Vessel Structure Aligning Network	The paper has novelties and solves a challenging problem (self-supervised learning/multi-modal registration). The results show the improvement over prior works.	The system seems to be robust, and a push forward in the good direction. However, it's not highly innovative, as it mainly relies on 2 already established neural networks with some fine tuning on top. The utilization of homography as the only type of warping for the creation of the synthetic dataset and the utilization of low resolution RGB images are weak points, but not enough to prevent the acceptance of this submission.	The research is meaningful, the logic is clear, and the experimental results are convincing.
338	Multi-Modal Unsupervised Pre-Training for Surgical Operating Room Workflow Analysis	In my opinion, the paper tackles an in interesting problem, but it still has a lot of missing information and unclarities that need to be addressed.	The use of multi-modal data in pretraining.	The technical contributions are limited. The proposed model borrowed many concepts with [4] hence I was expecting to use [4] as a baseline.
339	Multimodal-GuideNet: Gaze-Probe Bidirectional Guidance in Obstetric Ultrasound Scanning	This work presents an innovative problem formulation, with measurable real world implications and that could be applied to further scenarios. I believe this idea deserves being advertised within our community.	THis is a ground-breaking example of the effective use of AI to facilitate the use of Ultrasound in under-resources communities. Very exciting work with an immediate practical application	The paper presents a novel idea with scientifically sounding formulation of the problem. The paper is also very well written and structured.
340	Multiple Instance Learning with Mixed Supervision in Gleason Grading	The authors propose a novel manner to make use of the limited pixel-level annotation to boost the WSI grading, and also a random masking stragety to train a mixed supervision Transformer, and obtain promising peformance.	Propose an interesting way of mixing two levels of information for an improved cancer grading. Still, some questions on the experimental results, though.	Although the idea of mixed supervision is interesting, the novelty of the entire work is not so adequate for the conference, where simple masking strategy and sinusoidal position encoding are widely used in computer vision. In addition, the effectiveness of mixed supervision is not so convincing as presented in the experiment.
341	Multi-scale Super-resolution Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging with Adjustable Sharpness	Based on the novelty and good organization, also, the insufficient comparisons and lacking of some details.	This work is similar with published work.	I suggest acceptance to this paper. The idea of using the scaling filter for blind SR is well motivated. The overall approach is clear and easy to understand. The experiment is aslo extensive to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.
342	Multiscale Unsupervised Retinal Edema Area Segmentation in OCT Images	looks ok, but I see some open issues	Overall, the manuscript is well written and well presented, and the experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of the approach over related state-of-the-art methods. However, the proposed architecture is heavily reliant on existing DCCS approach, making the theoretical contributions limited.	Since unsupervised segmentation has not yet gained enough attention from the research community, this paper does present an interesting network combining multiscale unsupervised clustering and segmentation to achieve unsupervised segmentation. However, clarification is needed for the main novelty of the work and the validation process.
343	Multi-site Normative Modeling of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Metrics Using Hierarchical Bayesian Regression	The reasons that I lean towards a weak acceptance is that this work presents an interesting application of normative modeling in hierarchical bayesian regression framework, with strong evaluation of the different model fitting strategies. The results clearly show the utility of this framework for evaluating the feasibility of analysing (and interpreting results of) neuroimaging data pooled from different clinical studies, a known challenge in data harmonization. The merits slightly weigh over the weakness that this paper may address in its revised form.	Lack of preparation. The manuscript is poorly organized. Interpretation of results needs to be improved	This is a decent dataset and relevant problem to tackle.
344	Multi-Task Lung Nodule Detection in Chest Radiographs with a Dual Head Network	This paper is well presented, organized, with enough details for reproduction. The proposed contributions are supported by experimental results. Ablation study is conducted to study the effects of proposed improvements. A nice paper for reading.	In this paper, multi task detection of thoracic pulmonary nodules is a good work. Dual head network is used for more effective detection on the model. However, the detailed description of the method is not clear enough, and the experimental part is not perfect.	The paper provides a novel solution to improve the detection accuracy by adopting the case-level classification network with the lesion-level detection network. Instead of using lesion-level detection results, the authors provide an alternative way to implement global classification results. The performance also shows the improvement in both the classification result and detection results.  However, there are some explanation needed for the design of this network and the design of the experiments.
345	Multi-task video enhancement for dental interventions	Evaluation results are not strong enough, suggesting the design of the multi-task architecture has room for further improvement. No dataset or source code will be available to the community.	Based on the contribution of new dataset and strong benchmark method, I make the rating.	Please see Weakness section
346	Multi-TransSP: Multimodal Transformer for Survival Prediction of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients	The effectiveness of the proposed model is clear though more clinical insights will be helpful.	The experimental setup is sound, and the ablation study clearly shows the contributions of the individual elements. I am missing key information about the data and other used features that this research can be reproduced.	Overall, the paper presents an interesting approach to solve an important problem in multi-modality fusion of imaging and text data. Further evaluation on more datasets (e.g. of other cancers, or on different splits of the same data) could greatly help in understanding the true advantage of the proposed method.
347	Multi-view Local Co-occurrence and Global Consistency Learning Improve Mammogram Classification Generalisation	Novel aspects, narrow application area, discussion could be more extensive.	The paper is novel and provide extensive comparisons showing the superiority of the proposed model in comparison with the previous works.	The writing is clear. The idea of using global and local information from two views is interesting. Particularly, a global consistency module and a multi-view local co-occurrence module were proposed, which are motived by the well-known transformer. The generalization of the proposed approach was evaluated on four datasets, including 1) testing subset of ANON 1, 2) ANON 2, 3) CMMD, and 4) InBreast. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
348	MUSCLE: Multi-task Self-supervised Continual Learning to Pre-train Deep Models for X-ray Images of Multiple Body Parts	The overall learning scheme is a simple combinition, while the experiments are very good.	The innovativeness is moderate, the method is effective and results are convincing.	This is a well-written paper that explains the method clearly. The paper proposes a framework that makes minor modifications to existing SSL and CL techniques and shows improvements on most of the evaluation metrics.
349	NAF: Neural Attenuation Fields for Sparse-View CBCT Reconstruction	This work is the first one I have seen which demonstrates the NERF concept applied to practically relevant CT with a measured dataset. The evaluation is very good and its very well presented. I admit to believe, low-dose CT using sparse-view CT is irrelevant. However, sparse-view CT also arises in motion-compensated CT and is therefore still a very relevant problem.	This paper proposes a new application of using implicit function to model the attenuation coefficient in CBCT reconstruction. This paper also tailors the position encoding with a hash encoder to adapt to the scanned human organs. This paper also shows promising experimental results.	As sparse reconstruction is a popular topic in CT reconstruction, the image quality is the major concern using various schemes. The authors need to demonstrate the superior image quality prior to the complicated network design.
350	NerveFormer: A Cross-Sample Aggregation Network for Corneal Nerve Segmentation	Whille not convincing, the works seems to improve the state of the art.	Overall a sound method but justification of the proposed method is weak. A lot of missing implementation details, which is difficult to confirm if the comparison to other methods was fair (e.g. number of layers, number of parameters, if model was fully converged, etc.).	"The model generalizability;
The imcomplete baselines;
The novelty of TDA module."
351	NestedFormer: Nested Modality-Aware Transformer for Brain Tumor Segmentation	In general, medical data have huge information in form of modalities and this is current area of research to take benefit of modalities together. The paper presented a new mmFormer architecture which can tackle this issue well.	Overall, I think the method is novel. The method and experiments are well demonstrated. Although the method is relatively complicated, but a clear ablation study makes it easy to follow.	My judgment is borderline, but the paper needs to be revised, so I decided to give it weak reject.
352	Neural Annotation Refinement: Development of a New 3D Dataset for Adrenal Gland Analysis	The novelty of the paper is low, the description of the method is not clear, the comparison experiments are not conniving.	"Improved segmentations based on human annotations. 
Good methodology contribution for shape modeling."	"Geometric deep learning has become more and more important in medical image analysis as the surface representation are closer to the real world ones. They deserve more attention in the community.

Enough contributions in both datasets and methods.

A few weaknesses need to be addressed in the rebuttal and I am willing to raise my score if the rebuttal addresses my main concerns."
353	Neural Rendering for Stereo 3D Reconstruction of Deformable Tissues in Robotic Surgery	Impressive results that seem to be superior to competition. Enthi=usiasm is dampened somewhat by the number of unanswered questions.	"1) Tool mask-guided ray casting is designed for eliminating tool occlusion. 
2) Depth-cueing resampling and depth-map loss are introduced to make NeRF effective on single-view reconstruction.
3) The proposed method is complete and the results are impressive."	In Section 2.5, the equation (3) and (4) are not well explained. Equation (3) is too dense, maybe consider dividing them and explaining each clearly and also make sure the meaning/definition of each parameters are described in the text. For example, the F, G, T in (3) and I in (4) were not defined in the text.
354	Neuro-RDM: An Explainable Neural Network Landscape of Reaction-Diffusion Model for Cognitive Task Recognition	Overall, I appreciate the methodological novelty in this work. I particularly like how the authors map elements of the reaction diffusion equation onto different neural network architectures. However, my enthusiasm is dampened by the overstated claims, lack of an ablation study, and several unclear details.	The flow of the article is excellent, the mathematical formalization is correct and elegant, the rationale described in the first paragraph of section 2 is outstanding, the images are very well taken care of and clearly contribute to the message of the article, the two experiments presented are well executed in my opinion and perhaps with a little more description in the generation of the model forward, I think one should not have problems to replicate the experiments and reproduce the results. In general, a very good article, from which I have learned a lot, and my congratulations to the authors.	While the methodology is interesting and novel, the major weaknesses of the paper are in the evaluation of their contributions and the design of experiments. The complexity of their model is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, several key details for implementation are missing.
355	Noise transfer for unsupervised domain adaptation of retinal OCT images	The main contribution of the proposed method appears to be from histogram matching, and not noise transfer as emphasized in the title and presentation. While this is not undesirable in itself, it should be clearly stated. Moreover, the comparisons against other methods might be more fully presented.	"The paper is clear, well written, and the validation experiments are enough
The proposed technique has minor novelty and contributions as the applicability seems to be very reduced to when the source domain is less noisy than the target domain. In real settings, target domain features might be unknown or likely more noisy, where this algorithm will not perform well"	I recommend accepting this paper. The authors sufficiently demonstrate that style transfer between the source and target domain can be achieved by combining content components from the source image and noise components from a target image after singular value decomposition. Their simple method does not require the modification of the basic model architecture or extra training of a style transfer model. In addition, the proposed method might be applied in domain adaptation of other medical imaging modalities such as CT with different doses.
356	Noise2SR: Learning to Denoise from Super-Resolved Single Noisy Fluorescence Image	"The topic of the paper is relevant and interesting to the MICCAI community .
It presents an innovative idea for Fluorescence image denoising based on single noisy observation. Authors propose a sub-sampler module that generates sub-sampled noisy images from the original one; and an image SR module that improves the sub-sampled noisy image resolution to that of the original one.
Although some information is missing in the results section (computational time and hardware), the results are good in terms of PSNR and SSIM."	This paper proposes a neat idea improving upon previous method significantly. I don't give higher score due to the lack of thorough evaluation on different image modalities. In general, this paper is solid in terms of both idea and experiments.	The presented method is very close to noise2noise method with small changes such as able to use sub-sampling module. However, the results are very competitive to the former N2N method. The paper does not show any comprehensive analysis on why the presented method is of advantage over other methods. In this light ablation studies are not provided which makes it hard to understand whether the sub-sampling module is helping of the pretext assignment is giving an advantage. It requires more work and insight.
357	Non-iterative Coarse-to-fine Registration based on Single-pass Deep Cumulative Learning	The paper proposed injecting the deformed moving image into the decoder as a novel idea. Although the evaluation is only on the brain MR datasets, this can be sufficient for this conference paper.	The main innovation of this paper is that a different registration architecture is proposed, some other aspects such as the loss function are the same as those proposed in previous work. In addition, the comparison experiments are not conducted using some common datasets such as OASIS.	Overall, the paper is very interesting, and the method shows great potential.
358	Nonlinear Conditional Time-varying Granger Causality of Task fMRI via Deep Stacking Networks and Adaptive Convolutional Kernels	The use of neural networks might be novel, but already used by other people. Moreover, the autoregressor coefficient for the linear case are already something like like machine learning predictor. If we focus on the non-linearity aspect, a comparison to Siguhara causality is necessary. The reported experiment is just an analysis for which more suitable tools exists, a further practical application is missing.	This paper proposed a novel perspective of utilizing a traditional effective connectivity estimation method (Granger Causality analysis). Using network as a non-linear approximator can improve the field of cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging at various aspects in a similar way of this work.	Since this problem has a long history and the corresponding methods are applied broadly by the community, it's important to investigate the properties of the model in detail to help the practitioner understand the limitations and strengths of the proposed method.
359	Nonlinear Regression of Remaining Surgical Duration via Bayesian LSTM-based Deep Negative Correlation Learning	The paper is well-organized showing a new approach for RSD prediction. The results are verified with good evidence in a public surgical dataset suppressing the state-of-the-art methods. The idea of averaging the predictions of multiple diversified submodels similar to the multi-headed mechanism shows good potential in this multi-task design.	"Overall this is an interesting paper which achieves strong results with a simple model. Additionally, it addresses an important topic in RSD prediction (uncertainty estimation).
Some questions regarding the evaluation should be clarified (cross validation?) and the proposed ablation study (w/o both DNCL and Bayesian) would be helpful in my opinion.
I find it hard to understand why the variance-maximization objective of DNCL is useful for uncertainty estimation but the results look promising. I believe this should be discussed more in the final version."	This work provides a novel BD-Net for residual surgical duration prediction, whose performance surpasses the SOTA methods. However, although the proposed methods are derived from existing approaches, the method details and training procedure should be presented more clearly.
360	NVUM: Non-Volatile Unbiased Memory for Robust Medical Image Classification	"The idea is relatively novel.
Well written. The overflow and structure are very clear.
The method is relatively clear.
Experimental results are good."	The idea is interesting, although some explanation on method and experimental results are insufficient.	The paper provides strong motivation, clear method analysis and comprehensive experiments with SOTA performance and large performance gain on two large real world datasets, with only minor weakness in experiments, therefore I recommend the paper being accepted.
361	On Surgical Planning of Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy with Patient-Specific CTRs	Novel approach and a clear application of it. Paper is well organized and clearly identifies the methods and how they address the problem of limited manipulability in PCNL procedures using CTRs.	This seems to be a promising approach to a clinically relevant problem but as the paper currently stands, it seems insufficiently validated (in its choice of metric and in comparison to previous works). More discussion on the proposed method's limitations and path to clinical translation would also make it stronger.	"1- topic
2-well explained
3-promissing results"
362	On the Dataset Quality Control for Image Registration Evaluation	The paper has a significant weakness, however I think this could be very easily addressed during the revision and rebuttal stages.	This contribution is providing a novel approach without really assessing the current state-of-the-art in assessing image fiducials, buids on unfounded assumptions and is somewhat unclear / imprecise in the description of the methods.	The major factor is the importance of the topic and the proposed method to address it.
363	On the Uncertain Single-View Depths in Colonoscopies	The novelty is interesting but the metrics and experiments are not well conducted/explained. The authors are the first to apply uncertainty quantification to this domain and introduce new methods for it. However, the results shown provide only limited support to the made claims. Improving on this front would greatly improve the generalizability of the work. The novelty of the work and the potential impact on other applications still motivates an accept in my humble opinion, albeit a weak accept, given the current limitations.	This paper presents a novel approach for estimating both depth maps and the uncertainty of colonoscopic images. The proposed teacher-student learning model with uncertainty further boosts the network performance.	While the paper needs improvement, it introduces nice concepts and shows interesting results. Due to the missing clarity, I would not recommend direct accept, but is a good candidate for acceptance after revision.
364	One-Shot Segmentation of Novel White Matter Tracts via Extensive Data Augmentation	The work introduced in this work is complete, the experiments seem to be nice, but their lacking of discussion in the SOTA augmentation methods hinder their contribution, and the writing in Section 3 also need improving.	The paper is well structured and the method is evaluated properly. The authors address a the weakness of an already existing approach and solve this weakness by introducing their approach of extensive data augmentation. I do not recommend oral presentation since the manuscript does not include any methodological novelty. It should be accepted though, since the approach to enable successful one-shot training is of interest to the community.	Given the fact that in the field the studies of analyzing white matter are limited by the number of available tract segmentations, the proposed method can be useful to generate potentially more based on existing data without requiring tons of manual seminations.
365	Online Easy Example Mining for Weakly-supervised Gland Segmentation from Histology Images	As described in weakness, a very similar idea has been already published and there is no discussion about the contribution from the related paper. In addition, the evaluation was not sufficient. In the paper, comparing weakly-supervised methods is important, however, the authors listed many supervised methods and only one weakly-supervised method. Therefore, my rating tends to 'reject'.	Some details in the paper need to be improved.	The proposed method improves weakly supervised semantic segmentation performance over prior art, including an improved supervised baseline. However, comparison is somewhat limited. For instance, only a single WSSS model i.e., SEAM was included in the evaluation. Therefore, performance improvements may be mainly dependent on other factors such as multi-scale testing and architectural choices. If the authors can adequately clarify/address the concerns, I am willing to raise my score.
366	Online Reflective Learning for Robust Medical Image Segmentation	Overall, this is an interesting paper though with some issues to be addressed. I strongly suggest the authors to handle these problems. Due to the good writing, well-motivated problem, interesting and novel method, extensive experiments and results and the demos, I recommend to accept this paper.	The paper is missing details on some of the method components. Nevertheless the architecture choices are sound,  the application is important, and the paper is easy to follow.	The idea is novel, though I have concerns regarding the design of the methodology, e.g., the instability of the optimization at test time, the missing stop criterion to prevent overfitting. As a result, quite a few failure cases can be found in the results.
367	OnlyCaps-Net, a capsule only based neural network for 2D and 3D semantic segmentation	Authors propose a new way for optimizing current capsule network on public dataset with novel squashing functions such as softsquash and unitsquash, and compare their work with another public work from literature.	The major factor which decides me is the gain of speed and the reduced memory consumption compared to usual capsule networks.	"Although it does not solve any critical problems, it is, in my opinion, a topic of interest to the community to try to optimise the resource cost of complex models to make them more accessible.
Unfortunately, these observations have not been satisfactorily discussed by the author."
368	Only-Train-Once MR Fingerprinting for Magnetization Transfer Contrast Quantification	"They proposed an Only-Train-Once MR fingerprinting (OTOM) framework to estimate water and MTC parameters from MR fingerprints regardless of the MRF sequence. Unlike the previous deep learning studies, the proposed method was trained with numerous patterns and lengths of MRF sequence, allowing
them to plug any MRF sequence rather than a fixed MRF sequence. The flexible OTOM framework could be an efficient tissue quantification tool for various MRF protocols."	"Problem is well motivated
LSTM approach seems appropriate
Claims need to be toned down - random sampling necessarily does not extrapolate to every scheme and especially needs further testing and validation for generalization. The use of TL indicates some of these challenges."	The proposed Only-Train-Once MR fingerprinting (OTOM) seems a promising solution of estimating quantitative parameters from different MRF schedules, eliminating the process of lengthy data preparation and model retraining for a different MRF protocol.
369	Opinions Vary? Diagnosis First!	The experimentation and results are somewhat lacking and need more work in order to propel this idea into a valid proposal.	"clarity of the paper, 
only one metric"	The topic of this paper is good. But the writing of the paper is needed to improve and more experiments needed to supplement.
370	Opportunistic Incidence Prediction of Multiple Chronic Diseases from Abdominal CT Imaging Using Multi-Task Learning	The problem is interesting and the training and validation are well performed, even though doubts about the results arise (see above).	This study provided a meaningful approach for opportunistic incidence prediction, and the multi-planar 2D CT processing method can provide reference for other researches. If the details can be added after major revision, this is a meaningful work. Thus, I suggest receiving it after major revision.	I feel the concept and work related to multi-task learning and multiple disease prediction is the way forward for DL models in healthcare, and I found the paper enjoyable to read. There are some aspects that might require some working - perhaps to answer some of the questions I have and any other comments from other reviewers.
371	Optimal MRI Undersampling Patterns for Pathology Localization	"This paper tries to get the optimal undersampling patterns in k-space that maximize a target value function of interest in the segmentation
and localization problems, and then employing a new iterative gradient  method.
The effort is novel. The fact that the authors have run their approach on different MR data is quite helpful. Main comments: Even though the results look promising, how to validate the  learned undersampling patterns working well?  Will it miss some important information?"	Overall, the manuscript is well presented, and the proposed method is well developed and analysed.	The major factor for my score is that they aim to find the optimal MRI under sampling pattern for downstream pathology localization instead of whole image quality. The paper shows improved performance on validation on large public data. The hyperparameters are given for reproducibility.
372	Optimal Transport based Ordinal Pattern Tree Kernel for Brain Disease Diagnosis	the paper yields very good results, it seems technically sound and it improves the state of the art.	"The paper organization is clean.
The work has certain novelties."	My current judgement is based on the methodology in this submission. I look forward to seeing the rebuttal from the authors.
373	ORF-Net: Deep Omni-supervised Rib Fracture Detection from Chest CT Scans	Even though I have many question regarding the training and testing process, the idea of the paper is relatively novel for the task.	Pretty clear presentation of an add-on training strategy (though the innovation is limited) and grounded comparison and justification of the effectiveness of the proposed method. I only have some suggestions for further investigation, which is better to have.	This paper introduced a new omni-supervised learning framework which is useful for training models with different types of supervisions. This can be extended to many different problems and applications. The proposed method also achieves state-of-the-art performance on a new rib fracture dataset.
374	Orientation-guided Graph Convolutional Network for Bone Surface Segmentation	"Overall, the study is designed well.
The study clearly indicates the benefits of the proposed method in comparison to other machine learning methods
The paper is well organized"	Some sections need more clarification to better understand the work and its significance.	The work presented in this paper was performed rigorously and is described with a thorough level of detail. This work would be of interest to the MICCAI community, appealing to both the MIC and CAI backgrounds. The paper could be strengthened by more complete descriptions of the clinical motivation and limitations of the proposed approach.
375	Orientation-Shared Convolution Representation for CT Metal Artifact Learning	Nice work.	The novel formulation using rotational symmetry property.	The paper is extremely hard to follow and the proposed prior knowledge is unconvincing. The mathematical justification of the network architecture seems superfluous. Once those motivations are stripped, the paper essentially proposes a novel network architecture. The evaluation is only done on simulated data and the results are visually inferior to other methods evaluated. Therefore in summary I am unconvinced this method improves over the state of the art.
376	Out-of-Distribution Detection for Long-tailed and Fine-grained Skin Lesion Images	"The paper is overall welll written and clear except at a few places. 
Good results.
The detail of the prototypical network training is missing. 
Missing references and comparisons against the literature."	The paper is well-written and organized. The presented idea is interesting, has been adequately evaluated on two different datasets, and performs better compared to other methods. The idea is motivated by the limitation of other methods when applied on real-life clinical datasets. I think the paper will be interesting to MICCAI audience after doing the requested revisions to some parts.	The paper appears to be quite clear and the reading flows well. The OOD issue, studied on the dermatology imaging, is relevant to other imaging areas as well so may be interesting for the community.
377	Overlooked Trustworthiness of Saliency Maps	I question some scenarios where the paper demonstrated the saliency relevance and resistance. Nevertheless, this is an interesting topic that needs exploration, and I base my evaluation on these points.	This work helps to draw the community's attention to the (lack of) trustworthiness of most interpretability saliency map methods. They propose two novel properties to evaluate the trustworthiness of saliency map methods. Experiments are well-performed and demonstrate the lack of robustness of several widely used saliency maps. This work is worth discussing at MICCAI as it demonstrates clear failures of currently used interpretability methods.	NA
378	Parameter-free latent space transformer for zero-shot bidirectional cross-modality liver segmentation	The driving factor is the lack of inclusion of baselines for zero shot learning.	The authors propose a zero-shot bidirectional cross-modality liver segmentation method by investigating a parameter-free latent space through the prior knowledge from CT and MR images,which address the domain shift in cross CT-MR liver segmentation task. The evaluation is done on a variety of datasets. The structure of the manuscript is clear. This is an interesting and good paper.	"For recommendation 1: The paper uses a backbone network to verify the difficult problem of cross-modality, which is not very strong to prove the problem if it is the only experiment, and the experimental results it produces may also be the deficiency of the backbone model itself. In addition, the backbone is not one of the best backbones (e.g., nnunet, swin-transformer) available.
For recommendation 2: The important innovation of the article is to propose a potential space to map the features of two different modalities, which makes the difference minimized to achieve better cross-modal segmentation results. The experimental results of the article show that there is a large difference between the experimental results of CT to MR and MR to CT, and this difference cannot effectively explain the commonality of the features of the potential space proposed in the article for the two modalities, and it can be found from the results that the potential space is more biased to the representatio"
379	Patcher: Patch Transformers with Mixture of Experts for Precise Medical Image Segmentation	Please refer to the weakness.	The main factors for my rating are mentioned in Question 3 and 4.	The paper is clear and presents a novel model. It is not certain that it beats all other SOTA method, as some papers claim higher scores on the KVASIR-seg dataset, but it contains many nice ideas that could be used in future research and good justification for the different design choices of the presented network architecture.
380	Patch-wise Deep Metric Learning for Unsupervised Low-Dose CT Denoising	The limited sample size and one-time split could not verify the generalization ability of the proposed algorithm.	"There is a lack of explanation of proposed methods used in the study to demonstrate the novelty .
There is a lack of more reliable experiments and the ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability, especially the CT numbers shift."	"This paper shows a new perspective on a relatively old problem, and then proposes a novel, yet simple method to deal with it.
The statistical results display this method's superiority over others, and ablation studies well justify the choices made for hyperparameters."
381	PD-DWI: Predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive breast cancer with Physiologically-Decomposed Diffusion-Weighted MRI machine-learning model	I enjoyed reading this paper, it is a solid investigation, but the novelty and impact might be too limited.	The proposed model showed improved prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer using publically available BMMR2 breast data challenge.	At a time when deep learning is rampant in Medical Image Analysis, we need exploration and application in traditional signal processing and medical physics algorithms. The work was not innovative enough, but overall it was a good study.
382	Personalized Diagnostic Tool for Thyroid Cancer Classification using Multi-view Ultrasound	The paper presents an intresting approach for thyoid nodule classification. There is no discussion on how feasible is to implement this tool in a real-time clinical scenario (on a matter of processing time) while we are talking about multi-view images.	The research idea is interesting and relately novel, but the conducted experiments are quite limited.	The proposed method is simple and reasonable, yet both personalized weighting generation and view-aware contrastive loss in the model are frequently used. Furthermore, the personalized weighting generation module is similar to the attention machanism, why didn't the authors choose it?
383	Personalized dMRI Harmonization on Cortical Surface	This work points out an interesting question on dMRI harmonization. But the proposed method is not convincing since dMRI data was not naturally used to define local correspondence and there is no comparison with the standard cifity format.	Novel surface-based DWIs harmonization. Minor weakness due to lack of statistical test for numerical results.	Strong study design and implementation
384	PET denoising and uncertainty estimation based on NVAE model using quantile regression loss	The idea is interesting and valuable but the novelty seems limited and the results not strong enough.	The topic of this study carries a great interest in the research field of using PET imaging to improve the image signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the application of the deep learning approach has gained great support to improve PET image signals and other medical imaging. I would accept this paper to be presented at the conference.	The use of the quantile loss is interesting.
385	PHTrans: Parallelly Aggregating Global and Local Representations for Medical Image Segmentation	Please see the above comments.	"Add detailed experiments of UNETR and Swin UNETR to make fair comparison,  I would change my opinion and tolerate lack of novelty if it proves it is a real SOTA which outperforms extremely than UNETR and Swin UNETR. Besides, I would be more appreciated if the author would release the code in Github to check its reproducibility. Because this paper has been released on ArXiv, 
the total community would testify its real performance and so do I."	"This work looked at a popular and important problem in medical image segmentation and proposed reasonable novel hybrid architecture with extensive experiments that justified the proposed method. The work is also well written. Hence I recommend ""6: accept""."
386	Physically Inspired Constraint for Unsupervised Regularized Ultrasound Elastography	Although the methods are sound, the paper makes only a small contribution to the very large body of literature on ultrasound displacement tracking and is of interest to only the subset of ultrasound researchers in elastography who don't already have their own solutions.	"See section ""strengths""."	"The authors design a new physically inspired constraint to improve lateral displacement estimation, but it is limited to uniform axial strain.
The experimental results show that the proposed framework is superior to the current methods but lacks methodological innovation."
387	Physiological Model based Deep Learning Framework for Cardiac TMP Recovery	Despite the lacking validation, the  method novelty is interesting  and worth discussing.	"interesting method
results shown on limited size simulated data without a commentary about its application on real data"	Embedding the physiological model of TMP recovery inside the DL-based network makes this approach novel and interpretable. The only concern is that how this work is compared to a recent study with a similar approach.
388	Physiology-based simulation of the retinal vasculature enables annotation-free segmentation of OCT angiographs	Overall this paper is novel and with fair contributions. The weaknesses are lack of details on the specific trainings in the paper, which are moderate at most.	The paper addresses an important clinical problem, the physics-based simulation algorithm used here, is novel and the synthetic dataset performed similarly like real data. It can be a useful technique in the long run as data availability is an issue in medical imaging.	This paper presents ideas for OCTA simulation. There are still room for improving the model with better performance.
389	Point Beyond Class: A Benchmark for Weakly Semi-Supervised Abnormality Localization in Chest X-Rays	The two regularization terms (multi-point consistency and symmetric consistency) proposed to improve the original framework seems interesting and novel, and experimental results proved the effectiveness. However, it seems an incremental improvement on an existing model, and some details need to be made clear.	Overall, I believe this is a good paper with clear motivation and reasonable design. It would help some of the researchers in this field with a new benchmark and a way for self-supervised learning.	"The authors claim to have produced a ""publicly available benchmark"" without publishing any code, which does not fit my description of such a benchmark. If this is because of the double-blinded review process, they should clearly state that. The authors should either publish this code or change their claim to ""a new method""."
390	Poisson2Sparse: Self-Supervised Poisson Denoising From a Single Image	The proposed approach is devised to use the DNN in the framework of analytical method	"The scientific premise of the paper is incorrect.
The experimental depth is insufficient. The paper results may be reported incorrectly. The data used is of questionable quality."	Good novelty, but not clear writing and illustrations.
391	Pose-based Tremor Classification for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis from Video	The manuscript is clear and easy to follow, and the results are plausible.	The main limitation of the paper is related to the understanding of the clinical context of Parkinson's disease, and the related motor and no motor symptoms. The work is not useful for early diagnosis.	The paper presents a novel, low-cost and computationally efficient approach for a problem with great clinical relevance.
392	Position-prior Clustering-based Self-attention Module for Knee Cartilage Segmentation	If the authors emphasize that the proposed method is for a medical problem/scenario, then it must be shown that the method is highly matched to the problem (the methodology and experiment to support the method to match the problem).	"Technical novel;
Outperform the previous methods."	The paper presents an add-on module that could be used to improve global connectivity of segmentations on different tissues. The approach is flexible to be incorporated into any encoder decoder -based segmentation models.
393	Predicting molecular traits from tissue morphology through self-interactive multi-instance learning	An interesting paper but contains some flaws.	The method is well-motivated and the experimental results are convincing.	It is mostly based on some weak points in the experimental configuration. Even though the overall experimental structure can be sufficient, there are a number of points that need clarification before acceptance.
394	Predicting Spatio-Temporal Human Brain Response Using fMRI	The study is interesting. The framework is novel. However, some technical details are missing. The experimental results are relatively not sufficient.	This paper has a rich theoretical derivation process, and has a more detailed explanation for the model proposed in this paper, which has strong persuasive force.	This work proposed a novel approach in modeling the brain dynamics. The results seems promising, and it can be potentially applied for super resolution of fMRI data. The experiments and discussions may not be suffient.
395	Privacy Preserving Image Registration	All described above already.	The problem is pratically valid with little discussion.	The work is interesting, but the authors do not show evidence of the need to develop such an algorithm.
396	ProCo: Prototype-aware Contrastive Learning for Long-tailed Medical Image Classification	The authors aim to tackle the long-tailed medical classification task by using prototype learning and contrastive learning. Experiments seem good in the present form.	I don't think the paper is in a complete form. But I believe the future version could be improved.	The proposed ProCo is a novel method to address the long-tailed problem. The paper is well written, well organized, and sufficient experiments are conducted. There are no major weaknesses in this work. The sensitivity analysis on hyperparameters might increase the importance of the method.
397	Prognostic Imaging Biomarker Discovery in Survival Analysis for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis	this is good paper in every aspect, which can be potentially extended to broader applications for different diseases and image modalities.	This is a novel work with a clear and interesting application. Methodology is sound and statistical significance has been computed. I thus recommend this work for acceptance.	The paper proposed an interesting framework and the empirical evaluation suggests that it is effective, however additional baselines in the experiments and a justification of the selected hyper-parameters would strengthen the paper.
398	Progression models for imaging data with Longitudinal Variational Auto Encoders	It is a good method to generate images along time and predict meaningful parameters that can represent disease progression at the same time.	My recommendation is based on the difficult of the problem and the smart solution proposed by the authors. I believe this is a strong paper suitable for publication in Miccai. I expect that the authors follow on with this interesting research and move into the use of the latent space parameterization for prognosis and interpretability.	A work has its merits but desiring more work to domenstrate or justify them.
399	Progressive Deep Segmentation of Coronary Artery via Hierarchical Topology Learning	"-Key factors to segment small segmentation target, including anatomical structure relationship and topological information, are integrated in the FCNs in the proposed framework. This is important work in segmentation of small anatomical structures.
-Evaluation results prove effectiveness of the proposed method."	The two main reasons that influence my decision are: 1) the experiment in this paper is not sufficient to demonstrate the innovation points proposed by the author, and the experimental results did not show the segmentation quality for the lesion areas, which was insufficient to demonstrate the realization of accurate coronary segmentation. 2) the method proposed in this paper is not a very interesting innovation, and the use of the spatial dependency has been weakened.	The methodology is in general well described and evaluation has been done comprehensively with very good results.
400	Progressive Subsampling for Oversampled Data - Application to Quantitative MRI	Misleading/unclear performance claims	I doubt the motivation of the task to be solved. If I could learn about the significance of the task or application of the method on a more obviously useful compression problem my opinion could change. However, I also highly doubt the evaluation. Since the task is not well studied, I believe only comparing it against versions of one related method leaves a high risk that many existing methods could perform similarly well.	The authors have demonstrated improvement over an award winning submission with a different approach that is easy to implement although recursive. The quantification of the results can be improved as in the comments.
401	Prostate Cancer Histology Synthesis using StyleGAN Latent Space Annotation	The major consideration for the recommendation is the lack of clinical application of this approach.	I think it's a very challenging indication (prostate cancer) and important problem of generating synthetic data and validating it by pathologists.	I like the idea in principle. I think the paper as it is needs to be improved in terms of clarity.
402	PRO-TIP: Phantom for RObust automatic ultrasound calibration by TIP detection	The scientificity of the designed phantom needs to be further verified.	-Novel phantom design, easy to manufacture and open source code.	The paper is well-written and the techniques proposed would be of interest to the MICCAI community; however, the amount of critical information and discussion that is missing in the current version must be addressed in order for the work to be properly understood.
403	Prototype Learning of Inter-network Connectivity for ASD Diagnosis and Personalized Analysis	"This work properly reuses the well-known neural components to solve a real clnical problem. Eventhough there might not be novelty in each component of the proposed method, the mixture of them and how the problem is formulated is deemed novel. The results are promising compared with similar methods. The method is well-explained. 
As a  bonus point, it is worth thanking the authors for their prospective code release."	I found the idea of utilizing prototype learning for generating neuroscientific explanations interesting and possibly novel for functional connectivity analysis. However, I had several concerns about the experiment design (hyper parameter settings, soundness of clinical interpretation), due to which I would recommend a  weak reject.	This paper proposes some interesting ideas for analysis of FC data, using multi-headed attention to learn relationships across a sequence of networks seeded by an ROI, and using this representation for prototype-based classification. However, the choice of 1 prototype per class is somewhat questionable, and many details need to be clarified to be able to fully assess the work.
404	Pseudo Bias-Balanced Learning for Debiased Chest X-ray Classification	Please see the comments in 8.	"Questionable experiments but can accept if appropriate explanations are provided. 
Weak accept for incremental results"	The authors explained their method in a clear and reasonable way. Each step  is well founded and seems feasible to me.
405	Radiological Reports Improve Pre-Training for Localized Imaging Tasks on Chest X-Rays	Technical novelty, reproducibility, and results achieved.	Novelty is limied. No new method is proposed in this paper. They just analyze the the effectiveness of existing self- and text-supervised methods in different tasks, and do not analyze that why the text-supervised method is better and how the radiological reports help to improve the performance.	This paper is a comprehensive and extensive study of contrastive supervision and text-supervision for pre-training on unlabeled dataset. By providing the detailed comparisons, this paper has the potential to inspire more principled studies on self-supervised learning for localized medical images tasks.
406	RandStainNA: Learning Stain-Agnostic Features from Histology Slides by Bridging Stain Augmentation and Normalization	"Lack of statistical analysis given the stochastic nature of the method.
Lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods"	The overall idea is quite interesting but with the unclear description and no cross-validation of the results it seems that the reliability of this article is questionable.	Although the combination of stain normalization and augmentation is interesting and has some degree of novety, the overall novety of this paper is limited and the propsosed framwork is lack of depth in methodology perspective.
407	Real-Time 3D Reconstruction of Human Vocal Folds via High-Speed Laser-Endoscopy	Weak literature review and weak quantitative evaluation.	It is a very well written manusctript presenting scientifically sound (and potentially amenable to cilinical workflow) framework/pipeline for real-time 3D reconstruction of vocal folds geometry. It appears that the weakness/weaknesses in terms of interpretation of the of the results obtained in terms of the accuracy and robustness that would be required for clinical application can be addressed by revising Results and/or Conclusiosn section without any need for obtaining additional results.	The presented methods have limited novelty. However, the authors have validated their method on in-vivo human data. In addition, the dataset will be made publicly available encouraging further research in the field. Considering all these factors, I would accept this paper if my concerns listed above could be adequately addressed.
408	Recurrent Implicit Neural Graph for Deformable Tracking in Endoscopic Videos	First use of graph methods that I've seen in this medical field.	"The method is quite complex, making it difficult to explain.
However, I feel like the explanation could be made clearer by moving around and reworking some sentences in the methods section.
Alternatively, this may be better suited for a (longer) journal paper?"	The method seems to be working well. Also, the fast inference time makes the proposed method quite useful.
409	Reducing Positional Variance in Cross-sectional Abdominal CT Slices with Deep Conditional Generative Models	The application seems novel. But the paper misses a detailed illustration on the clinical potential of the application. The author should answer my concerns in the weakness part.	Interesting and important problem. Some novelty in the formulation.	Application seem somehow new but there is not enough experiments  for fair comparison such as popular defacto GAN methods  CycleGAN or Pix2Pix.
410	RefineNet: An Automated Framework to Generate Task and Subject-Specific Brain Parcellations for Resting-State fMRI Analysis	This paper provided a method to optimize the functional brain parcellations based on the existing parcellations according to functional profiles,  wihch can be appended to existing networks.	method is novel. writing is clear. results are convincing.	The paper proposes a method for task-based individualized parcellation, which is different with the traditional parcellation framework.
411	Region Proposal Rectification Towards Robust Instance Segmentation of Biological Images	This paper looks interesting and achieves good results.	"This work is well-written with clear motivation, novel method, and impressive results. 
The limitations of this work do not hurt the overall quality of this work."	The proposed module is novel and improves bbox regression. However, the segmentation quality improves marginally.
412	Region-guided CycleGANs for Stain Transfer in Whole Slide Images	My two concerns on bounding boxes (the generation of bounding boxes and their fixed size) weaken the paper's contribution. So I would like to give rejection to the paper before reading the rebuttal.	"The proposed modifications improve the baseline as validated by the qualitative and quantitative results on two datasets.
A bottleneck in the model performance is due to the annotation quality. However, the utilized annotation pipeline is based on image processing that does not require manual efforts for GT preparation (to train a segmentation model). With this annotation pipeline also, the performance is better in contrast to compared methods. However, the effect of this factor should be explored in future work.
Although the analysis is limited to one application, it is sufficient to validate the proposed approach."	I think methodology-wise this paper is good. My concern is the experimental results part which I think should be improved.
413	Regression Metric Loss: Learning a Semantic Representation Space for Medical Images	My rating is based on the good quality of the presentations and novelty.	Although the methodology seems interesting, the method description and motivation clearly lacks of clarity	This paper proposed a novel loss to make DNN more valid. But it is lack of more validation analysis to clarify the superiority of the proposed loss.
414	Reinforcement Learning Driven Intra-modal and Inter-modal Representation Learning for 3D Medical Image Classification	The idea is novel and strong. Paper is well written.	This paper doesn't meet the standard of MICCAI yet.	This paper innovatively introduces the reinforcement learning strategy into the intra-modality learning and inter-modality learning and also presents a novel hierarchic feature enhancement framework for multi-modality learning.
415	Reinforcement learning for active modality selection during diagnosis	This is a good paper that would benefit the community - provided there is some extra justification on the limitations of this approach the paper should be accepted	The paper works on an interesting diagnosis decision-making problem. However, the paper is limited in terms of modality scopes and experiment clearness.	The manuscript presents sufficient methodological novelty in a clinically relevant task. It is well written, presents adequate experiments and a great clinical analysis/discussion of the method and its results.
416	Reliability of quantification estimates in MR Spectroscopy: CNNs vs. traditional model fitting	This paper sheds light on a previously-unrecognized major problem with one of the popular new approaches for MR spectroscopy quantification.  This has the potential to be very impactful	It's a solid piece of work, albeit a little niche and simulation only.	I found the work to be novel and detailed in the analysis, although limited in scope (single architecture, synthetic dataset). I think it is a good fit for MICCAI and a valuable contribution for addressing potential weaknesses in deep learning approaches compared to traditional methods.
417	Reliability-aware Contrastive Self-ensembling for Semi-supervised Medical Image Classification	Well organized and explained paper, for me it is wonderful	The proposed method is of great novelty, and the experiments are extensive and sufficient. The proposed method achieves very good performance on two datasets, outperforming compared methods significantly. The manuscript is well organized, clear and easy to follow.	The proposed learnable weighting function for each data is novel. Applying this weight to the consistency and contrastive loss improves the overall model performance.
418	ReMix: A General and Efficient Framework for Multiple Instance Learning based Whole Slide Image Classification	Overall, this work provides strong empirical evidence and has no major weaknesses. It would be interesting to see more comparisons with other recent MIL methods, however the work in its current form is sufficient to be considered at MICCAI. I believe the research community working in WSI can benefit from this simple and effective technique.	The authors proposed an efficient ReMix for WSI classification. Though promising results have been shown, the novelty is limited, and it looks like an add-on model based on existing MIL methods. Also, the lack of interpretability and selection of augmentation technique will make it more challenging in practice.	This work address reduce high resource consumption for WSI classification. The novelty of this work is enough for the conference. Significant performance improvements.
419	RemixFormer: A Transformer Model for Precision Skin Tumor Differential Diagnosis via Multi-modal Imaging and Non-imaging Data	"However, there are some places that are not clearly expressed.
In Section 2.2, ""When DWP is turned on (based on p > Tp, p  [0,1])"", what does p mean here? How is the p obtained?
What are the global features and local features?
In fig. 2, what does patch token mean? It's never shown in the main text.
Section 2.3 is very confusing. 
For example, the authors mentioned gc or gd are generated by GAP layer, gm is generated by LN layer. But in the formulas below, it's zx and gx' that are generated by LN and GAP. I don't know if the gx' here represents the same gc, gd, gm mentioned before, or it means something else. 
Also, I suggest to add the notations lc, ld, and lm(if there is one) to the figure 2."	The paper show an exmaple of how to use a transformer based model for nulti-modal data fusion. Experiments are performed two datasets. But technical novelty is missing, so I weakly accept it.	The paper has clinical application metrits and technical innovations. The paper will benefit the research community. The only concern is the reproducibility. If the authors could release the code, that would be great.
420	Removal of Confounders via Invariant Risk Minimization for Medical Diagnosis	The manuscript is very clear and the proposed solution is appealing. The experiments are interesting and the contributions are important. The manuscript has only very minor issues. The main drawback - which is understandable for a conference article - is the experiment and results section that could be more extensive. But again, it is a minor issue.	Removing the effect of confounder variables is an interesting research area.	The paper's treatment of confounding variables in the medical image analysis literature is timely, and the usage of the invariant risk minimization framework is interesting. Although I have concerns regarding the class-conditional penalty's applicability and the comparison with respect to invariant feature representation learning methods, I will argue that the paper is strong enough to be presented at the conference.
421	RepsNet: Combining Vision with Language for Automated Medical Reports	It is a nice application.	The gap between technical pipeline and transfer of it to the clinical practice.	The method is not attractive, and Med-rad results are not convincing enough.
422	Residual Wavelon Convolutional Networks for Characterization of Disease Response on MRI	Overall, this is a nicely written paper exploring a concept that, while not dramatically novel, is worth investigating. Wavelon networks have not made a major impact on medical image analysis so far, and based on results of this paper, it is unclear whether adding residual links will increase the overall impact. If larger data sets and/or a wider range of data and clinical tasks were used, it could be more convincing.	Poor innovation and experimental results	"The author develope a new architecture form networks, layers and activation perspective using wavelet theory. They evaluate their outperform in different cohorts and topics. They deliver a variation of different network comparison in each topic. 
Novelty in architecture, design in network to layer and activation level. A very well organise manuscript with very sientific evaluation of the hypothesis. Nice Figures and verification of the ideas. 
No obvious weakness. Just I suggest a source code of the deveolped layers and networks."
423	Rethinking Breast Lesion Segmentation in Ultrasound: A New Video Dataset and A Baseline Network	"The paper is well written. 
A novel video ultrasound lesion segmentation dataset is presented. 
Nice application of the Transformer modules in automated lesion segmentation"	The introduces automated breast lesion segmentation dataset using ultrasound video is novel. The proposed decoupled spatial and temporal decoupled transformer is efficiently formulated and properly assessed.	"Though the novelty of the methodology is not very significant, the dataset is a contribution. Overall, I think that the merits weigh over weaknesses and recommend ""weak accept""."
424	Rethinking Surgical Captioning: End-to-End Window-Based MLP Transformer Using Patches	Considering both its advantages and drawbacks, I find it an interesting paper overall.	Interesting work on Surgical Captioning using the novel SWIN architecture. Evaluation and Ablation could be in more detail e.g. comparing to other works on the same task and dataset. The main concern is that there is no evidence that this work is more suitable for real-time applications than other methods with separate detection and feature extraction step - This concern should be addressed.	Experiments
425	Rethinking Surgical Instrument Segmentation: A Background Image Can Be All You Need	Not very novel; but, decent result.	It seems that the results presented in this work are very preliminary. In particular, the lack of comparison with existing approaches makes it difficult to evaluate the contribution of this work.	The major factors to influence me is the analogy of the method to things seen outside of the community (i.e. self-driving cars and video games) to make it more widely interesting to a broad MICCAI audience, the simplicity of the method, and the attention taken to perform ablation studies to begin the quantify its performance more robustly. Yes, there are some weaknesses, but nothing to distract from those more core strengths.
426	Retrieval of surgical phase transitions using reinforcement learning	The insufficient experimental validation is my major concern.	There is a clear contribution which is relevant to the community. The results were compared with the relevant SOTA models (TeCNO, Trans-SVNet) in the domain. The release of the in-house dataset would add value to the research community	"The authors present an interesting new task formulation for offline phase recognition.
However, while the idea is promising, there are many open questions regarding the method's design which indicate poor behavior in edge cases. E.g. it does not seem like the model can handle missing phases.
Another weakness is that the results are only compared to online approaches (which is a considerably harder task). It is not clear if the proposed RL formulation could compete with the offline variants of standard phase recognition models (e.g. TeCNO or Trans-SVNet)."
427	Revealing Continuous Brain Dynamical Organization with Multimodal Graph Transformer	The study is interesting. The framework is novel. However, some technical details are missing. The justification about experimental results is relatively weak.	The research topic is very important to the research field, and the proposed method provides a new avenue to deepen the understanding of brain dynamical organization.	The method is novel but the writting quality is very poor.
428	Rib Suppression in Digital Chest Tomosynthesis	The paper is well-written, the method is interesting, and the application is important. However, the major concern lies in how can this method be deployed in real-world scenarios with real data with and without rib, and how to achieve better performance on the real clinical dataset.	Interesting idea, writing and organization of the paper	In conclusion, revealing the nodules covered by rib shadows on a single or limited view of XR (such as DCT) is another highly ill-posed problem. The proposed solution addressed it in a way that separates the rib artifacts. There have some unclear points that can be minorly clarified to improve the current exposition of the paper.
429	Robust Segmentation of Brain MRI in the Wild with Hierarchical CNNs and no Retraining	"The proposed framework can be a potential benchmark in MRI automated  segmentation of brain structures. This will also aid clinicians in analyzing neurological disorders better. 
Very well written paper by providing sufficient details for each section considering the space constraints. Clearly defined Additional details were provided in the supplementary material."	The authors propose and improved version of SynthSeg. However, the comparisons implemented are not enough, as there are plenty of works (in challenges for instance) with public databases which could have been used for comparison purposes.	This method is based on SynthSeg network. And its three components including two U-Net blocks and one denosier block which have been proposed and widely used in other references.
430	RPLHR-CT Dataset and Transformer Baseline for Volumetric Super-Resolution from CT Scans	"I had the feeling that a lot of points are mixed up and not clear to the reader because of the broad range of points that are tried to make here.
The pure description of the dataset and baseline and domain gap analysis one one hand or the proposed network and subsequent analysis on the other hand would have been more appropriate considering the paper limit."	"Authors promise to present a new dataset for the benchmarking, yet it is not clear how the dataset is different and if it is any better than Li et al. [1] (880 images vs. 250). Authors should elaborate the advantages of their data.
Authors showed the superiority of the model w.r.t. SOTA models. However, it is not clear which parts of the model were important, i.e. TVSRN-Encoder is worse than TVSRN only by 0.002 in terms of SSIM - really marginal and precludes me to give a higher score. Authors ought to provide stronger support for why their model's architecture is advantageous. Phrase ""TVSRN outperforms existing algorithms significantly."" needs to be justified."	Good novelty, adequate work, and great contribution to the community.
431	RT-DNAS: Real-time Constrained Differentiable Neural Architecture Search for 3D Cardiac Cine MRI Segmentation	"*	This paper is an incremental work from the prior art, and there are some similar works as mentioned in the weaknesses of this paper
*	The comparison experiments are not comprehensive. Lacking comparison to the state-of-the-art methods"	Latency is relavant for some medical image segmentation problems and the proposed method incorporates it in the NAS and achieves better results than the baseline manually designed methods and other NAS derived methods.	Their logical extension of the MS-NAS to incorporate latency and optimizing for both backed up by good experiments.
432	RTN: Reinforced Transformer Network for Coronary CT Angiography Vessel-level Image Quality Assessment	"Mathematical formulation not clear enough
Experiments only on inhouse data and with inhouse implementations of alternative approaches
Conceptual flaws
 . Fully automatic centerline tracing as preprocessing step, whose result may as well be impacted by poor image quality
 . Are really all conceivable kinds of artifacts handled by the method and properly represented in the data collection?"	The paper is well-written and well-organized. The proposed method formulate the image quality problem as a multi-instance learning problem, and combined with reinforcement learning to remove irrelevant features which makes the network focus more on important features. And the authors did ablation study and comparison experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	The whole idea of transformer based multi-instance-learning +  RL based instance discarding model is novel.
433	S3R: Self-supervised Spectral Regression for Hyperspectral Histopathology Image Classification	The novelty and the completeness of experiments.	The paper presents a novel approach that is shown to provide a superior classification performance and training efficiency compared to contrastive learning. However, the paper has some limitations detailed above which needs to be addressed.	The proposed strategies from this paper seem interesting in Spectral-Spatial Feature Learning for HSIs, but more evaluation results need to be provided to demonstrate the improvement.
434	S5CL: Unifying Fully-Supervised, Self-Supervised, and Semi-Supervised Learning Through Hierarchical Contrastive Learning	"Overall, the main contribution is extending the SupConLoss to multiple levels (i.e., supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised). Although the novelty seems somehow incremental, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and it is beneficial to the community.
The major concerns are on experiments."	I make the decision mainly according to the novelty of the proposed framework and the organization of this paper.	I am recommending a weak accept mainly due to some missing details in the text and the fact that the proposed method heavily borrows from already published literature. However, I believe it is still has a merit for the community.
435	Sample hardness based gradient loss for long-tailed cervical cell detection	The method is novel and the experiment results prove good. But the rationality of gradients being related to sample hardness needs insightful explaining. And the scale of the dataset needs to be clarified. I'd consider raising my score on this paper should proper explanation be provided.	There is few work focusing on the hardness of the samples in the classification task. This work provides a unified framework to take the hardness into account for both head and tail classes. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of their methods especially for the rare classes.	"1.Clear description about how the method works;
2.Clear states about how it differs from existing methods;
3.Amazing performance improvements;"
436	SAPJNet: Sequence-Adaptive Prototype-Joint Network for Small Sample Multi-Sequence MRI Diagnosis	"this paper proposed to use Transformer and additive-angular-margin loss for small sample multi-sequence MR image classification. However, this paper has several major flaws and fails to illustrate their point:

The first component, Transformer model, is claimed to filter intra-sequence features and aggregate inter-sequence features, based on attention mechanism. But I didn't see any details about how to achieve these 2 goals in section 2.1. The overall writing quality is poor and difficult to follow.
Similarly, neither the section 2.2, prototype optimization strategy, illustrates how to approximate the intra-class prototype and alienate the inter-class prototype. For example, the query sample q^a and support sample s^b corresponding to which modalities, the loss_2 should be explicitly expressed like loss_1, and why you choose the additive-angular-margin loss instead of the ordinary cross-entropy loss for classification.
Fig 2 is very ambiguous and lacks sufficient explanation."	This paper addresses 2 common and important questions facing the use of clinical MRI in deep learning. The proposed method shows reasonable result compared to several other approaches. However, the study has several limitations as mentioned above.	The paper is well written. The methodology proposed to handle sparse distribution and mylti-sequence images is novel. They utilize SOTA attention mechanism and contrastive learning in different stages of their architecture. The results show a justifiable improvement when compared against other methods.
437	SATr: Slice Attention with Transformer for Universal Lesion Detection	This is a solid paper with minor issues. The idea is not too novel but is solid and so are the experimental results.	This paper propose a novel way to enhance the key-slice feature on ULD task, by using the self-attention block and modifying the query, key and value component in a reasonable way. However, the final design needs more justification. On the other hand, the paper lack of analysis on the introduced additional computation overhead and the performance improvement is not significant.	See the strength
438	Scale-Equivariant Unrolled Neural Networks for Data-Efficient Accelerated MRI Reconstruction	"Even though the experiments showed better performance with the proposed method, the overall opinion is ""weak reject"" because of the mentioned weaknesses and execution of the idea."	The motivation of this work is clear, the method adopted is intuitive, and the experimental verification is sufficient, so I recommend to accept.	"It is well motivated and results are good. 
Novelty lies mainly in transferring the use of scale-invariant networks to MRI reconstructions, which is limited in novelty."
439	Screening of Dementia on OCTA Images via Multi-projection Consistency and Complementarity	The article discussed an interesting topic and provided a well-designed framework to show the feasibility. The proposed method adapted the popular dot-product attention to combine multiple projection features of OCTA, which I think is a good application. However, the experiments are not sufficient to prove the effectiveness of the method.(see point 5 for details)	The paper is well organized, and the proposed method is innovative in dementia screening on Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography images. However, the proposed method is not novel enough.	Idea and results are good, and the task makes sense
440	Scribble2D5: Weakly-Supervised Volumetric Image Segmentation via Scribble Annotations	"The paper produces SOTA results that provides practical utility by reducing the requirements on manual segmentations. 
Much of the contribution is adapting other methods to work in 3D."	The experiments were comprehensive and showed promising results.	This paper proposes a weakly-supervised volumetric image segmentation network, Scribble2D5. This method tries to reduce the performance gap between weakly-supervised and full-supervised segmentation methods. Meanwhile, there are some concerns on missing related references, insufficient comparison and evaluation.
441	Scribble-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Dual-Branch Network and Dynamically Mixed Pseudo Labels Supervision	The paper is highly interesting. It presents a novel technique for scribble-based segmentation, which favourably compares to several baselines. The experimental design is restricted to a single dataset, but thanks to ablation studies and further analyses the results are convincing.	This paper proposes a simple yet efficient dual-branch network with one encoder and two slightly different decoders for image segmentation. And the paper is well-written and easy to understand. However, the proposed method is not a new idea, and the experiment is insufficient. There are several concerns above in the current version of the paper that addressing them will increase the quality of this paper.	
442	SD-LayerNet: Semi-supervised retinal layer segmentation in OCT using disentangled representation with anatomical priors	"This paper proposed a novel reconstruction loss that has been proved efficient in the experiments, and a strong experimental validation is provided in this work.
The minor concern is that the proposed reconstruction loss requires more parameter tuning. It would be interesting if the authors could explain or set up more experiments to validate the lambda values."	As shown in the weaknesses.	The problem concerned by the paper is meaningful, the proposed method is also technically novel.
443	SeATrans: Learning Segmentation-Assisted diagnosis model via Transformer	The results.	The idea is interesting.	The authors have used an innovative approach to fuse the segmentation masks into the classification network. They have validated their work by comparing to a large number of existing methods. And their method outperforms these baselines in terms of AUC. They have also investigated the effectiveness of adding each part of their proposed method by an ablation study.
444	Segmentation of Whole-brain Tractography: A Deep Learning Algorithm Based on 3D Raw Curve Points	Though there is a data contribution, the technic contribution of this study is very limited. It is basically a fiber classification model rather than a segmentation approach and the experiment settings (e.g. preprocessing and input format) lead to a relatively simple task hence bringing few impact/benefit to the area.	It is an interesting work of classification with location and was performed on the raw data, although blind classification may be more interesting. But the performance was not fully validated and some details need to be provided.	I have read the whole paper carefully and understand all the parts. Based on the strengths and weakness in Q4 and Q5, I give the overall score for this paper.
445	Self-Ensembling Vision Transformer (SEViT) for Robust Medical Image Classification	performance is good and motivation is novel	The main factors are insufficient experiments and the lack of novelty.	Well-written context and new aspect of the evaluation study.
446	Self-learning and One-shot Learning based Single-slice Annotation for 3D Medical Image Segmentation	This is a good paper with an interesting method and thorough evaluation.	The main factor for my overall score is the lack of novelty plus the lack of explanation convincing me that the baseline methods were implemented correctly and still perform so badly. But, the method is still addressing a good problem and has nice results, so could still fit in at MICCAI.	no missing parts, well written, clear results, best paper in my stack.
447	SelfMix: A Self-adaptive Data Augmentation Method for Lesion Segmentation	It should be explained more clearly why it is distortion free.	"Nice technical contirbution on an effective method for data augmentation in image segmentation. 
But the presentation, clarification and results can be greatly improved."	Method
448	Self-Rating Curriculum Learning for Localization and Segmentation of Tuberculosis on Chest Radiograph	The proposed ranking function design may be of interests of broad audiences, and may inspire other researchers in designing their ranking functions when using curriculum learning methods.	Even though the proposed self-rating of image difficulty for curriculum learning seemed useful and somewhat novel, I wasn't convinced that it couldn't be replaced by a straight-forward method such as comparing how much ground truth differed from classifier output probability.	Nice and simple solution to increase the model training performance, which can be applicable most of the medical image analysis problems. However, the proposed approach did not provide a comparison with the base solution.
449	Self-supervised 3D anatomy segmentation using self-distilled masked image transformer (SMIT)	Overall, it is a great study that incorporates local and global information into masked autoencoders, yielding performance improvement on two datasets. The authors also benchmarked with several representative self-supervised methods on CNNs and Transformers. However, several aspects need to be clarified, such as (1) the relationship between [CLS] token and global information and (2) the conclusion of 1-layer vs. multi-layer decoders.	"The method is well presented and sound. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
It would be better if one more ablation study (sse above) is added."	The improvements over other SSL methods on two public datasets are significant.
450	Self-supervised 3D Patient Modeling with Multi-modal Attentive Fusion	Most of the manuscript except for 3D mesh estimation is clear and easy to follow, and the results are plausible.	The paper is very well written and addresses the challenging problem of 3D mesh estimation from multi-modality images. The only concern in the proposed fusion approach is a fair comparison against the state-of-the-art RDF model. The authors should consider addressing the issues described above.	The paper presents a solid contribution to the field and the results are encouraging. The flaws in the evaluation and description thereof, and the lack of critical discussion of the results, in particular in terms of clinical significance, prevent me from giving the paper a higher score.
451	Self-Supervised Depth Estimation in Laparoscopic Image using 3D Geometric Consistency	The paper adds useful information to the standard methods of stereo reconstruction from endoscopes, and I believe makes a valuable contribution to the literature.	I feel this was one of the stronger papers in my stack, it has its limitations but at least proposes something fairly novel and validates on a well known dataset. I would definitely not argue strongly for it to be included, but it was at least interesting and the idea makes sense.	This work focused on the important direction of using geometric consistency to improve laparoscopic image depth estimation. Yet, the scientific novelty of the paper is limited, and the experiment results are not able to prove the merit of one of the major contributions.
452	Self-Supervised Learning of Morphological Representation for 3D EM Segments with Cluster-Instance Correlations	A new method, full evaluation, very good results.	I really like the topic of this paper, which applies contrastive leaning approach to learn point cloud features for 3D neuron morphology. However, the writing does not make it clear which part is from the previous work and which is new contribution. In addition, the experiment section lacks comparison with prior work on either the same task or the point cloud contrastive learning methods.	The motivation is clear. The motivation is clear to integrate the feature correlations at the instance level and cluster level.
453	Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Nuclei Segmentation	The work is relevant, sound and results a promising. Presentation may be improved.	Please see my comments above.	"Overall I think the idea of predicting the patch features from the neighboring patches is interesting. This kind of idea has also been adopted by other concurrent papers, but from a different perspective. From the experimental results, it can be observed that the proposed method has some advantages over previous approaches. But it is unclear if such advantages still hold after employing Vision Transformers in the baseline methods. Also, this paper lacks important ablation studies; also it lacks some comparisons with other generic self-supervised learning methods.
To summarize, the major factors that led me to the overall score are: novelty and experimental validation."
454	Semi-supervised histological image segmentation via hierarchical consistency enforcement	"Few incremental novelties that fit together well.
Strong baselines.
State-of-the-art open access datasets.
Relevant problem for computational pathology.
Well written manuscript.
The only drawback of the paper is that do not discuss the boundary separation problem, which is important in this segmentation task."	The paper presents a simple framework to exploit unlabeled data alongside limited labeled with HCE modules and novel learnable HC losses. I appreciate the extensive experiments and ablations with recent works, to both validate the proposed losses and their contributions in learning. According to results the model has the most improvement when the amount of data is very small, but it is not proved that the model has performance gains due to the proposed HCE module or it is also due to under-fitting.	Although the novelty is limited, the results are encouraging. I may raise my rating if authors could resolve my concerns regarding the perturbations.
455	Semi-supervised Learning for Nerve Segmentation in Corneal Confocal Microscope Photography	The paper is well written, methods and results are clear. The proposed methods is interesting. Some parts of the proposed method are a novelty, and consequently the overall method is a novelty applied to corneal nerves images. The improvement in the segmentation of corneal nerves is limited.	The paper is good at implemenation but the novelty of the paper is not strong for MICCAI.	Good work but some important descriptions need to clarify.
456	Semi-supervised learning with data harmonisation for biomarker discovery from resting state fMRI	"Lack of survey on the related recent work
No loss term for the site-related parameters of $\gamma_{iv}$ and $\delta_{iv}$
Inconsistency for the performance of the competing method to the original work"	While I asked for some additional highlights, I think this is a great paper to be discussed by the community. Data harmonization is very important and it is good to see a combined approach including classifiers.	To help solve the important problem of data harmonization across imaging sites, the proposed method nicely incorporates the harmonization into a VAE model that also jointly learns the target classification task. However, I have concerns regarding the assumptions of the harmonization model for handling neurologically different groups, and very importantly the paper does not present any comparisons to other data harmonization techniques.
457	Semi-Supervised Medical Image Classification with Temporal Knowledge-Aware Regularization	The experiments lack of key ablation analysis and the comparison experiment is somewhat unfair.	"good technique contribution
good performance on three datasets
the paper is well-organized and easy to follow"	As described in strength, the paper organization is good, and the proposed method is well designed, and the evaluation is basically sufficient for MICCAI. Therefore, my rating tends to 'acceptance'.
458	Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation Using Cross-Model Pseudo-Supervision with Shape Awareness and Local Context Constraints	Please refer to the strength(4), weaknesses (5), comments (8) for justification.	The paper presents a simple but effective semi-supervised approach. It is not exceptional in terms of novelty, but it is solid given the benchmark results.	A good method to incorporate prior shape to segmentation with neural networks that is currently not sufficiently addressed. Could be more forthcoming for pre-processing conditions.
459	Semi-Supervised PR Virtual Staining for Breast Histopathological Images	It is a very good scientific contribution in the field. The experimental framework is robust and denotes a lot of experimental work and analysis	All in all it is a well structured paper providing an interesting idea in the field of digital pathology. The reliability of the results might be questionable and majority of evaluation is qualitative (hence subjective), but nevertheless the performed study seems to be improving the knowledge in the domain.	The paper is interesting and well written but deserve to be slightly improved (English and explanation) and perhaps more technical details about color analysis in part 2.1 as well as pathologist perception of brown color in the virtual stained slides.
460	Semi-Supervised Spatial Temporal Attention Network for Video Polyp Segmentation	Overall this is a decent paper worthy of acceptance for it's application novelty. There are no major issues with the paper, but also nothing particularly novel in terms of technical innovation.	The manuscript present a new approach for semi-supervised polyp segmentation using video data. It is very well-written and needs some adjustments and improvements to highlight the advantages and the feasibility of clinical applications.	Segmentation performance is good and basic improvement was done by adding the two recent modules.
461	Sensor Geometry Generalization to Untrained Conditions in Quantitative Ultrasound Imaging	Generalization to multiple probe geometries is a very interesting and novel contribution, with high potential impact to other US-guided applications. The paper is well-written and the evaluation looks robust, even if poorly described. I think the paper can be considered for publication, provided that authors improve the description of the conducted experimental evaluation and the obtained results.	Network structure and the proposed method are explained well	The paper has the merit of acceptance in MICCIA. Some of the modules such as meta-learning and DSA should be explained clearer.
462	SETMIL: Spatial Encoding Transformer-based Multiple Instance Learning for Pathological Image Analysis	The design of the network is effective. The novelty is not described clearly.	"Although the practical application of the current framework is questionable, the ideas in SETMIL for mimicking the clinical practice by aggregating representations of both
neighbour instances and globally correlated instances are interesting."	Enough innovation and extensive experimentation plus acceptable results are main reasons for the acceptance.
463	SGT: Scene Graph-Guided Transformer for Surgical Report Generation	Interesting method with promising performance achieved	Although the flaws in clarity and organization, the task of surgical report generation is relevant for the medical image analysis community. Additionally, the paper's main contributions correspond to the technical novelty of the model supported in the empirical results that outperform the state-of-the-art. This work could be improved with some modifications, but its contributions support its acceptance.	The proposed method is novel and interesting. The experimental results could demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The strengths outweigh the weaknesses listed in above.
464	Shape-Aware Weakly/Semi-Supervised Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation with Regional/Marginal Consistency	Despite the shortcomings (which are fixable in the camera ready), I believe that the paper (both method and its application) has value and is of interest to the community.	Even though the paper brings some new ideas in semi-supervised segmentation and vCDR prediction, the technique contribution is limited.	"The research has a positive effect on computer assisted diagnosis, and the method is novel, the results are promising, and the writing is fluent. 
Vertical cup to disc ratio (vCDR) is an important observation factor in the diagnosis of glaucoma, the usual method in the computer-aided diagnosis is to segment the optic cup and disc region first and then calculate the vCDR. The optic disc and cup segmentation via deep learning can obtain positive results, however, these deep learning methods need a large size of training data. This paper designed a framework which can train a segmentation model by using small size data of optic disc and cup labels and large size data of vCDR labels. This is an effective weakly/semi-supervised approach and is reasonably interpretable. In my opinion, this study is more enlightening to the field of optic cup optic disc segmentation."
465	Shape-based features of white matter fiber-tracts associated with outcome in Major Depression Disorder	This paper is generally very good, but I am not convinced by the approach used for doing the association analysis. If this is fixed, then I think this should be accepted, but I am concerned that this might be too much to ask for at this stage.	The clinical application is interesting. Not only a novel technical application, but also working towards a biomarker.	I have not been able to find critical issues.
466	ShapePU: A New PU Learning Framework Regularized by Global Consistency for Scribble Supervised Cardiac Segmentation	A novel approach in reducing the annotation workload, a sound presentation of results as well as ablation studiy and comparison to other sota methods.	"Authors explain their paper, show all the experiments and work done, and compare and quantify themselves against other existent methods.
Reproducibility is important if the authors provide the code."	The method proposed in the paper has potential but is weighed down by the lack of clarity in the equations and assumptions. Nevertheless the results look promising and seem to work on multiple dataset outperforming existing methods.
467	Show, Attend and Detect: Towards Fine-grained Assessment of Abdominal Aortic Calcification on Vertebral Fracture Assessment Scans	"This paper has explored a proposal on how automated assessment of AAC (Abdominal Aortic Calcification) could be done. 
The usage of an attention based encoder-decoder network is something novel when compared to the 3 related works highlighted in the paper.
Further, it assists severity classification as well. Tough the accuracy is not that high, the idea has the potential for future expansion."	I think the way the problem is framed is interesting and producing individual scores can provide clinical value. The limitations in the evaluation as well as the discordance with the publication for the baseline model lower my enthusiasm.	The proposed method is quite interesting, with a fair degree of novelty, and its application purpose is of great importance. However, some of the presented results are not convincing enough (e.g., correlations with human scores in table 3 are very low). Moreover, result validation could be a bit more extensive and the paper suffers from a lack of clarity at some points.
468	Siamese Encoder-based Spatial-Temporal Mixer for Growth Trend Prediction of Lung Nodules on CT Scans	"The idea is of the paper interesting and very useful in for the medical field.
The prediction of the growth of lung nodules can assist in multiple tasks like future treatment orientation or overall survival estimation of patients.
It would be good to show some examples where the algorithm failed and explain why
The components of the framework are not innovative and have been used before."	The CT dataset NLSTt constructed in this paper is a good work to predict the evolution of lung nodules, and it is a good idea to construct a spatial-temporal mixer (STM) module to effectively utilize the spatial and temporal information of the ROI. However, the detailed description of the method is not clear enough, and the experimental part is not perfect.	Authors proposed a novel framework for nodule trend prediction but comparisons with the state-art-the-art is limited. I would suggest accepting it.
469	Simultaneous Bone and Shadow Segmentation Network using Task Correspondence Consistency	"Please, keep my recommendation under the others reviewers comments regarding to novelty.
The paper is clear and the methodology consistent. An overall (small) improvement on the results are presented. All these together compile a good paper."	While the framework is novel and interesting. The problematic ground truths can affect the validity of the work.	The clarify of the paper is outstandig.
470	Skin Lesion Recognition with Class-Hierarchy Regularized Hyperbolic Embeddings	"The proposed research contributes to solve an important medical problem.
It also include methodological contributions."	It is an inspiring work with solid clinical importance. It will promote the society to pay attention to advanced geometry research.	My decision is primarly based on the marginal increments in performance of the proposed method with the baselines in table 1. I would be willing to change my rating if more evidence of the benefits of the proposed approach is shown.
471	SLAM-TKA: Real-time Intra-operative Measurement of Tibial Resection Plane in Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty	the remaining open questions to the methods make it difficult for me to fully assess the merit of the proposed method	The formulation method is interesting and critical for improving the intra-operative TKA surgeries.	The paper is very well written. I also like the elegant solution: SLAM is not novel but the application of SLAM on TKA seems novel and the paper demonstrated promising accuracy and robustness in terms of resection plane estimation (<3 degree).
472	SMESwin Unet: Merging CNN and Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation	"Simple combination of the existing methods that limits the technical novelty of the method. 
Limited discussion on the experimental results. 
No comparison to SOTA on these datasets used here."	I. think that the knowledge contribution may be not enough for a MICCAI paper and the presentation quality is also a concer for publication.	It is one interesting and convincing manuscript. The only main concern for me is in my opinion, experiments of swin transformer with CCT should be included to prove the MCCT, the added CNN branch, is useful as mentioned in point #5.
473	Sparse Interpretation of Graph Convolutional Networks for Multi-Modal Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease	The contribution in terms of originality of the approach and its significance are moderate. Sparsity in GCNs is not a new framework/approach. I am not confident about the efficiency and robustness of the approach since the paper doesn't show clear evidence about time complexity of the SGCN computations and the impact of K (in KNN) on sparse matrices. My rating could change if the authors clarify my concernes.	"This paper is proposing interpretable model for Multi-Modal Diagnosis of
Alzheimer's Disease. Proposed method utilizes Graph Convolutional Network for doing the classification task along with obtaining interpretation on input features."	The work of this paper has good innovation and practical significance, and it is recommended to accept.
474	Spatial-hierarchical Graph Neural Network with Dynamic Structure Learning for Histological Image Classification	"This paper well explains the problem it is addressing that is of clinical importance in the disease diagnosis through histology image classification.
Most relevant prior works have been addressed and their shortcomings have been explained.
The proposed method has been designed to address the initially presented problems.
Claims have been addressed through the experiments and the story makes a good sense."	"The paper is well-written and it shows a good validation on multiple datasets, however there are some concerns regarding the details of GraphSAGE and transformer. For this reason I picked ""accept"" rate."	The results are not very convincing. It would be appreciated if F1 measures are added for the experiments.
475	Spatiotemporal Attention for Early Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma based on Longitudinal Ultrasound Images	Although the technical novelty of the proposed method is marginal, the method has some impact on early prediction of HCC based on longitudinal ultrasound images, which has clinical benefit and is a new application in MIC.	The paper presents a simple yet incremental approach that could be useful for a wide range of longitudinal image classification tasks (although the paper only demonstrates it on the task of HCC diagnosis from ultrasound). The experiments are clear and fairly convincing.	This paper applied transformers to the clinical task, which looks interesting. However, the ROI attention block proposed in the paper has not been effectively verified. To be precise, the experiment can not prove the superiority of ROI attention block compared to nonlocal attention [20].
476	Spatio-temporal motion correction and iterative reconstruction of in-utero fetal fMRI	The problem of fetal fMRI motion is well motivated. Looking at the spatio-temporal data as a whole is an intuitive approach. The use of TV is simple to implement and reproduce. The details related to computation - time, effort and convergence - needs to be discussed.	The motivation, method part are very well, but the experiment part can be much improved.	Novel motion-corrected reconstruction of 4D in-utero fetal fMRI by employing the spatial-temporal similarity, which results in much better image quality than non-iterative interpolation methods.
477	Stabilize, Decompose, and Denoise: Self-Supervised Fluoroscopy Denoising	The method is interesting, but in my opinion validation is not enough.	"Good paper from an overall perspective, but there are some curious points as in comments.
Also, the differenece and comparison to the robust image alignment method need to be clarified."	Novelty and Experiment
478	Stay focused - Enhancing model interpretability through guided feature training	It may be correct to view guided specific training as an improvement in the training model due to multiple supervision rather than XAI research.	"The idea of blurring the background for improving the interpretability seems to be novel
The idea for quantifying the increase in 'interpretability' trough focus is interesting
The performance (F1-Score) seems to slightly hurt or at most obtain comparable results than traditional training (without the idea proposed by the authors)
Additional experiments to support that the proposed idea improve the performance (on top of increasing the interpretability) will strength the paper"	I think overall, a well layed out paper, some methodologies to be given in more detail, but a nice approach that is interesting to read about.
479	Stepwise Feature Fusion: Local Guides Global	"The empirical performance of SSFormer seems good. Therefore I lean towards acceptance.
However a few important baselines are missing, and there are many issues on writing. The intuition of LE against ""attention dispersion"" is not clearly explained. I can only recommend ""weak accept"". The authors should heavily revise the manuscript to address these issues."	This work proposes a new framework for polyp segmentation, and achieves competitive results. However, the technical novelty is marginal. I prefer to have weak reject at the current stage.	Considering the clear motivation and reasonable contributions, the comprehensive experiments and the promising results, I think the paper has potential to be accepted. Even though there are a few deficiencies in the experiments and results, which cause some weakness of the paper, the overall rate of the paper should be above borderline.
480	Stereo Depth Estimation via Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning	Novelty, performance and reproductibility.	The application is novel and the performance is good, but the technical novelty is somewhat limited.	The contribution of this paper is limited. And there are much details unclear to understand the proposed method (see weakensses).
481	Stroke lesion segmentation from low-quality and few-shot MRIs via similarity-weighted self-ensembling framework	The rationale for the validity of the approach is not evident and is not presented in the paper, which raises question on the reproducibility of the results in a slightly different setup. This is exacerbate by: 1) the small size of the test dataset; 2) the lack of comparison of state of the art methods on the problem; 3) the choice of methods that were not designed to work in a scenario as described in the paper - use of datasets from different domains and semantic labels.	The authors propose a novel framework to segment stroke lesions in low-quality MRI. The contributions are explained in details and the method proposed could be useful in low-resources settings with a real-world application. Although it could be improved in some aspects, the manuscript is well-written and would be of interest to researchers in the field.	The proposed approach is interesting and novel, but does not provide enough comparisons/ablations to help readers understand how the different components work together to produce the more robust model that the authors achieve.
482	Structure-consistent Restoration Network for Cataract Fundus Image Enhancement	The study did provide several interesting results, the model proposed by the author has a certain improvement in evaluation metrics. The study overcomes the difficulty of collecting paired cataract images and enforces the structure preservation. But the samples of public data sets are few, so as to the public data sets. Besides IoU was not validated in the Kaggle dataset. the text also lacks clarity and not scientific, needs important English editing. Although the relevant weakness and comments are mentioned before, we still think the paper can be accepted weakly given that the comments given in the weakness are addressed properly.	The novelty of the paper is limited, but the contribution is solid.	This paper is technical sound, easy to understand, and satisfying in its novelty. Specifically, the authors analyzed the characteristics of fundus imaging and designed a cataract simulation model. In addition, the authors designed a feature alignment module for learning the correspondence between high frequency features and origin features, which is reasonable. However, the experiments are not sufficient, for example, some ablation studies are missing. Considering the above issues, I recommend to accept this paper.
483	Super-Focus: Domain Adaptation for Embryo Imaging via Self-Supervised Focal Plane Regression	This is a good conference paper, with simple but efficient methodology, clear presentation and convincing validation.	They are suggesting a relatively simple method addressing dataset standardisation across different domains.	Solid conference contribution that solves an interesting problem, nicely written paper, reasonable selection of methods that are not new per se but used in a clever way. Quite some validations including multiple expert assessments and relatively large data sets.
484	SUPER-IVIM-DC: Intra-voxel incoherent motion based Fetal lung maturity assessment from limited DWI data using supervised learning coupled with data-consistency	I like the paper and the approach but without a proper statistical analysis it is hard to judge its real value. The paper would also benefit from including more baseline methods. This should also not be difficult to realize. The presented measure for clinical impact also seems not really useful.	The paper shows clinical value and it would be relatively easy for other groups to implement the method.	This paper focus on fetal lung maturity analysis based on DWI data. It has clinical significance in fetal lung maturity analysis.This paper proposed a data-consistency term that enables the analysis of diffusion and pseudo-diffusion biomarkers based on DNN. Their work demonstrated the added-value of SUPER-IVIM-DC over both classical and recent DNN approaches for IVIM analysis through numerical simulations, healthy volunteer study, and IVIM analysis of fetal lung maturation from fetal DWI data. However, the proposed model lack of novelty. It is an improvement of IVIM-Net. The improvement of comparison experiments is not significant.
485	Supervised Contrastive Learning to Classify Paranasal Anomalies in the Maxillary Sinus	"With a top presentation I think the application & minor novelty would make me see this as a ""weak accept"" - ""accept"". However, given the current presentation I think it does not make the cut."	I appreciate the well-organised paper. I believe this paper can have good applicability potentials. But the novelty of this work is not good enough for MICCAI given that its a combination between existing works (See weakness). Also, the authors claimed that they will not release the code, which may cause reproducibility problems. Hence, I will suggest a reject score.	"The paper is clearly written and well structured. The claimed contribution is clear and experiments are done well.
Nonetheless, the claimed contribution does not stand out strongly - neither based on the conducted experiments nor by the theoretical analysis."
486	Supervised Deep Learning for Head Motion Correction in PET	"Language problems need to be checked, many long sentences are not clearly expressed and are confusing.
The experiments section needs more clarifications:
The subject group contains patients with normal cognition, cocaine dependence, and cognitive diseases. I would like to know if any strategy was used in splitting the training and test sets? For example, keeping a diversity of patient types in each subset.
In the ablation study (Table 1), the test MSE value for ""more data, FWT, Deep Encoder and Normal sampling"", which is located in the second row, has a much higher value than the others. Can the authors explain this?
The results In fig. 2(a) are for subject 1. Also, there is another subject 1 in Table S1. I assume they are different subjects since one is for single-subject experiments and one is for multi-subject experiments. But referring to them the same name still causes confusion."	This work aims to learn the rigid head motion second-by-second from dynamic PET image data, which is very challenging given the low quality image input. The authors demonstrated the results with transparency. There could be a few things the authors could try to improve the performance, such as finding computationally efficient ways to improve the input image quality, or exploring ways to reduce the data complexity for the low number of parameters in this problem.	This paper covers a very important clinicla issue and comes up with a nice methodologicla solution using state of the art computational approaches both wrt the learning framework as well as in general wrt the reconstruction framework and is teste don the state-of-the-art scanner, an HRRT.
487	Suppressing Poisoning Attacks on Federated Learning for Medical Imaging	"Well motivated and presented paper with empirical results comparing to other approaches.

Very little discussion about the limitations of the proposed method."	"The paper proposes an effective aggregation rule for FL learning, and the experimental results support some of the authors' claims. However, this work may bring limited contributions to the MICCAI community.

The proposed method is developed on the existing FL framework and changes the client scoring function by using COPOD. Although the performance is good, the methodology lacks theoretical analysis.

this work focus on an important research topic, Federated learning, but has a relatively limited impact on medical images and may be interested in a narrow group of MICCAI audiences. It would be more interesting and impact to enhance the connection between the proposed method and medical images.

Therefore, I think the weakness of this paper slightly weighs over its merits, and I suggest a weak reject."	Overall, I think this is an interesting paper with clear presentation. I hope the authors could address my questions.
489	Surgical Scene Segmentation Using Semantic Image Synthesis with a Virtual Surgery Environment	The merits of the paper include introducing a more complex surgery simulation, generated synthetic images from it and real dataset with more classes of organs and surgical tools. Extensive experiments with different combinations of dataset, e.g. real, synthetic, real + synthetic, etc, were performed, comparing against several previous methods for instance and semantic segmentation. Moreover, the new public dataset, which also addresses class imbalance problem, made the paper quite strong.	"This work is practical and solid. A novel large dataset is built and will be released to public. My major concerns include:

What are the most important insights from surgical synthetic data generation and application? The authors should emphasize this. This paper lacks theoretical contents. So the experimental insights are required.

In Table 2, the improvements given by synthetic data seem not significant. In Table 3, the relative mIOU increments are very significant. How do the authors explain the differences between the benifits for overall performance and class-wise performance."	The novelty and contribution of the presented work mainly lies in the published dataset which might be not as competitive in comparison with other MICCAI submissions.
490	Surgical Skill Assessment via Video Semantic Aggregation	Measures of performance are insufficient; measures of variance of estimates are missing. The method is interesting and a variant of existing methods that illustrate the relevance of known information.	Overall this is an interesting paper. Both the idea and experimental results are attractive. However, there is still concern about the writing and analysis of experimental resutls.	"The authors' motivation to address the shortcoming of state-of-the-art models by discovering and aggregating different semantic parts of the surgical setting across spatiotemporal dimensions is an interesting approach.
As the authors cluster spatial features, no supervision is required to discover these semantic features which are expected to belong to different surgical elements such as tools, the tissue, and the background."
491	Surgical-VQA: Visual Question Answering in Surgical Scenes using Transformer	Overall, I think this paper is an interesting paper proposing a BERT based framework on Surgical-VQA task. I hope the authors can address my concerns especially question 3 in the 'Weakness' and I'm willing to raise my score.	Although the task of surgical VQA is relevant for the medical image analysis community, the lack of technical novelty and the marginal improvement of the final model significantly affect the paper's main contributions. Additionally, it is unclear whether the data will be made publicly available upon acceptance. This work requires further modifications before being accepted.	High performance compared to the baseline model. The new caption dataset.
492	Survival Prediction of Brain Cancer with Incomplete Radiology, Pathology, Genomic, and Demographic Data	This work introduces a deep learning model for fusing multimodal data along with a comprehensive guideline to train it. The simplistic architecture and the easy training strategy may prove helpful for other researchers to train this model. In addition, the authors did a commendable job quantifying the importance of each of the modules.	The paper addresses the issue of handling missing data that is a very realistic problem faced in clinical applications	The paper is overall well-written, with a good setup and a good level of experimentation. The claims of the paper seem to be overstated.
493	SVoRT: Iterative Transformer for Slice-to-Volume Registration in Fetal Brain MRI	Despite the clear novelty and scientific value, i've found the evaluation of this paper unclear and weak. Overall it jeopardises my evaluation of the real added value of the proposed strategy.	"The paper is well-written and proposes a solution to a challenging clinical problem. The paper propose a new formulation to model slice-to-volume registration. They demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, particularly in accuracy of transformation. Furthermore, they conduct an ablation study and evaluate the significance of their volume estimation and positional embedding, justifying the reasons for their model design.
Their qualitative figures demonstrate the improvements brought by their network, and this work represents an important contribution in fetal brain image reconstruction."	The innovative merger of three paradigms (CNNs, Transformers and inverse problems) to solve SVR + the realistic look of the real dataset made my decision clear (although I would have preferred more than two examples on the real dataset, either as textual results or as images)
494	Swin Deformable Attention U-Net Transformer (SDAUT) for Explainable Fast MRI	The method design is novel and effective, and explainability is important for medical applications. However, there are some weakness as described in weakness and comment sections.	"The manuscript is of an engineering nature where two already developed approaches (Swin + deformable attentions) were combined. The experimental part is not strong, with the main claimed achievement of the article being the computational efficiency. However, there is no comparison with the other transformer-based U-Nets which also have much fewer parameters than the SwinMR.
Also, only 1 dataset is considered in the article; the single-coil vs multi-coil setup is not addressed. 
Given these issues, the score is below the borderline threshold."	The manuscript is clear and easy to follow, but the motivation of the design is not well-explained. The performance improvement is quite marginal. Nevertheless, the application of deformable swin transformer to fastMRI and the results on deformation fields/attention score for explainble fastMRI are the merits.
495	Swin-VoxelMorph: A Symmetric Unsupervised Learning Model for Deformable Medical Image Registration Using Swin Transformer	"The paper is clear, the proposed pipeline is, as far as I know, the first implementation of swin unet for image registration. The resulting registration method include all good properties expected: regularity, invertibility, symmetry.
Runtime and quality metric compare favorably to state of the art."	The paper is very well written and easy to follow and the only weakness is the clarity and description of the figures.	The problems to be solved are challenging, and it is worth encouraging to try to find a solutions with the latest methods. And this paper takes into account the topological consistency and differentiability for registration.
496	Tagged-MRI Sequence to Audio Synthesis via Self Residual Attention Guided Heterogeneous Translator	This paper raised an interesting research topic and the authors provided a fair solution to this problem. Some details were missing but overall a fair paper to be accepted.	This paper proposed a novel method, and this is the first attempt at translating tagged-MRI sequences to audio waveforms. The results are promising for applications.	The paper presents a novel and creative approach which could be used to understand the relationship between tongue muscle movement and speech.
497	Task-oriented Self-supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection in Electroencephalography	The moderate novelties of self-supervised learning for anomaly detection of EEG signals and the way of generating abnormal EEG signals.   However, the abnormalities generated may not be practical abnormal EEG signals, hence limit its applicability of application.	I am mainly concerned due to is applicability and experiment setting.	"Although the idea is similar to CutPaste and NormNet, it is valueable to see such a simulated-based anomaly detection method is effectiveness in EEG modality.  The experiments are well designed, especially the ablation study.
Also, there is a major concern : lack of comparision with supervised methods.
So, I recommend weak accpet."
498	Task-relevant Feature Replenishment for Cross-centre Polyp Segmentation	The paper is easy to follow, and tackles a real problem in medical image field. The validity of this approach is supported by the improved performance w.r.t. the other methods. Although some aspects need to be clarified.	This paper explore and exploit ideas from multiple CV tasks and achieve considerable improvement on the UDA tasks; on the other hand, some designs lack in-depth justification and discussion, making the overall story not sound and logically coherent.	The experiment is limited to still iamges that consist very few images. There are more few publically available video polyp segmentation dataset and also still image that have decent number of images (for example, Neopolyp (BKAI)) and few more. Experimental results on the larger dataset may help to justify the current improvement of the method and usability of the models in the clinic.
499	TBraTS: Trusted Brain Tumor Segmentation	I really appreciated the way uncertainty is computed, I think this approach promising.	This paper proposed a novel direction for uncertainty quantification by assigning the belief of mass with the Dempster-Shafer theory.  The proposal was evaluated with four metrics, Dice score, Entropy, ECE and UEO.  The authors also compare their proposal with the popular uncertainty quantification method, i.e.,MC dropout,  model ensemble.	See the weakness section.
500	Test Time Transform Prediction for Open Set Histopathological Image Recognition	I would recommend accepting this paper if ablation study is provided to justify the benefit of using color transform.	This research work seem to be reasonable, but should be further validated on by additional experiments.	Please see strengths and weaknesses above.
501	Test-time Adaptation with Calibration of Medical Image Classification Nets for Label Distribution Shift	The presented techniques are novel and likely useful to many practical applications.	My recommendation is based on my concerns in 4 and 5. I am willing to upgrade my score if authors can address my concerns in 5, that is, clarify the significance of addressing the label distribution shift issue.	My rank is primarly based on doubts on the value for the medical setting of this work. Anyway the work is valuable from all the others point of views and so I decided to leave a weak accept in order to wait for a clarification
502	Test-Time Adaptation with Shape Moments for Image Segmentation	The paper addresses a relevant problem of TTA using shape descriptors for adaptation. The amount of data available in the target domain could be low, and such methods are useful in those scenarios. The authors add minor changes to what is already proposed in ref [2] and [20]. Although the results perform better compared to other methods on the DSC metric, it is still significantly below the Oracle. It also does not do that well on the ASD metric on most of the cardiac classes and the prostate.	The major increase of performance using the introduced shape moments, even over domain adaptation methods which are specifically trained on datasets of the target domain outweighs the weaknesses of the work. The mathematical inaccuracies can be addressed and comments regarding the performance on specific datasets and the selection of the given shape moments can be included.	This work proposed a shape-guided entropy minimization objective to improve the segmentation performance in target domains. The experiments show the proposed work exhibits better performance.
503	Test-time image-to-image translation ensembling improves out-of-distribution generalization in histopathology	The novelty of the paper	"There are various points that need clarity.
The proposed approach is not scalebale."	Lack of proper experimental comparisons with simple but efficient competitive methods (see weakness #3)
504	TGANet: Text-guided attention for improved polyp segmentation	As shown in the strengths and weaknesses parts, TGANet proposes the label attention which can use the classification results to guide the segmentation features directly by byte-pair encoding and channel attention. Although TGANet contains many existing attention modules, the ablation study shows the necessity of the label attention. Besides, experiments show that the TGANet achieves better performance than other advanced models.	The idea of text-guided attention is innovative and impressive. The experiments are comprehensive. However, the authors did not adequately focus on text-guided attention. The insights and evidences about text-guided attention are lacking.	They conduct lots of experiments to show the improvement on four different datasets. As for me, I think this paper does not bring many new insights.
505	The (de)biasing effect of GAN-based augmentation methods on skin lesion images	Paper seem to be raising interesting topic of debiasing in GANs.	The paper is well written and motivated and I think it would pose a good contrast to the GAN papers that normally appear at MICCAI that propose new models. The main weakness I see is the lack of expansion of the method to sources of bias that are also very important in the area (namely race) which are harder to address using simulations in the same way that adding frames can be addressed.	The experimental setting is intersting. However, the conclusions are 'local' and may not be generalized to other medical applications.
506	The Dice loss in the context of missing or empty labels: introducing Ph and 	The paper has a significant contribution to the understanding of dice loss in the context of missing and empty labels. It provides a generalization of the loss and shows the impact of the parameters on segmentation performance in this context. However, its organization and clarity are lacking.	"Major factors: the paper writing and experimental verification.
Many descriptions in the paper are not clear. This prevents the understanding of this paper. For the experimental verification, some additional experimental results are needed to further verify the proposed idea."	The formulation is important. I agree with the authors that it could help other authors to clearly present their Dice loss implementation. The heuristics are well motivated and results seem promising. The experiments are not sufficient to fully illustrate the approach
507	The Intrinsic Manifolds of Radiological Images and their Role in Deep Learning	Good idea, experimental validation, and valuable insights	Even though the empirical finding has some flaws and theoretical contribution is not enough, the current finding of different scope of negative relation between test accuracy and ID is a fresh aspect to think the difference between radiological images and natural images.	
508	The Semi-constrained Network-Based Statistic (scNBS): integrating local and global information for brain network inference	The manuscript present an interesting extension of NBS and cNBS that overcome some limitations of those methods. The topic is surely of interest to this community. The proposed method is pretty interesting and the experiments provide support to the claims of increased specificity, power and consistency. The experiments are only on (semi) synthetic data and some steps of the description raise some doubts on circularity issues.	The proposed method could do statistical inference by accounting for both local and network-level interactions that might have clinical significance.	Interesting and clear paper, the methodology is sound and robust.
509	Thoracic Lymph Node Segmentation in CT imaging via Lymph Node Station Stratification and Size Encoding	Three super LN stations and learning framework are most important idea of the paper.  Proposed model consisting of super station based stratified encoders, size-aware decoder branches and a post fusion module performs high segmentation performance.  It is shown new approach improves the segmentation performance further.	There does not seem to have enough contribution for an acceptance.  The method, however, has good results comparing to others.	To overcome the difficulties of segmenting visible lymph node (LN) from CT images, a novel LN-station-specific and size-aware LN segmentation framework is proposed, which can explicit utilize the LN-station priors and learn the LN size variance Validated on the public NIH dataset and further tested on the external esophageal dataset, the proposed framework demonstrates high LN segmentation performance while preserving good generalizability. Although there is no novel structure or theories proposed in this study, the proposed method demonstrates high LN segmentation performance while preserving good generalizability. Thus, I suggest receiving it after major revision.
510	TINC: Temporally Informed Non-Contrastive Learning for Disease Progression Modeling in Retinal OCT Volumes	The novel and interesting extension of the recent VICReg method to longitudinal medical images and the demonstration of its utility.	novelty and few other weaknesses as given above	A new loss function to address a clinical-interested task. The authors also show promising results
511	TMSS: An End-to-End Transformer-based Multimodal Network for Segmentation and Survival Prediction	"The cropping approach which appears to use some domain knowledge that has not been clearly defined.
Multimodal approach that achieves SOTA performance."	"The application has clinical impact.
The method outperformed existing works.
Analysis is elaborate"	"The combination of transformer networks for simultaneously predicting lesion segmentations and survival estimates in order to achieve an improved estimate, and under the combination with EHR data to the best of my knowledge is unprecedented and has a large potential for a strong impact.
Further, the paper is very well-written and easy to understand."
512	Toward Clinically Assisted Colorectal Polyp Recognition via Structured Cross-modal Representation Consistency	The paper proposes an intresting approach that can be a solution for a clinical problem. However, better evaluation on a bigger dataset, better representation of the advantages over the state-of-the-art, and better discussion on the real-time clinical use need to be addressed in the manuscript.	Nice paper but there are some weaknesses that have to be solved.	This manuscript used the currently popular deep learning architecture, attention based vision model, to solve an important cross-model Colorectal Polyp recognition problem. Also, it improved the baseline model with its newly designed module. Similar method should be able to be applied to other similar problems.
513	Towards Confident Detection of Prostate Cancer using High Resolution Micro-ultrasound	This paper is clincally interesting.	The paper provides an interesting methodology with strong validation design and moderately strong validation results.	The major factors in my recommendation were the focus on an excellent clinical problem and appreciation for the advantages of confidence thresholding in order guide operators when using this model in clinical practice. This level of pragmatism baked in to the framework, coupled with the encouraging performance, motivated my high score for this paper.
514	Towards Holistic Surgical Scene Understanding	"Very complex dataset with timely challenges to teams participating in benchmarking (hierarchical annotations, spatio-temporal inference from video etc).
Very strong reference model TAPIR, to set a solid baseline performance for competing teams once the dataset goes public.
Overall, an extremely valuable contribution to the community."	The paper has strong contributions both on the novelty of their dataset and methods. The miccai community can benefit from such dataset for various video analysis tasks.	The dataset presented in this paper is valuable.
515	Towards performant and reliable undersampled MR reconstruction via diffusion model sampling	This paper proposed a novel diffusion-model-based MR reconstruction method, which is robust to the sampling patterns and the acceleration factors, the authors gave thougrough anylasis, great work!	Though the  combination of the diffusion model  and MR reconstruction framework may interest MICCAIers, the lack of important details make this paper difficult to follow.	This work combines a conditional reconstruction module and an accelerated refining module to improve the reconstruction of MR images with higher efficiency. Sufficient experiments have been done to support the benefit.
516	Towards Unsupervised Ultrasound Video Clinical Quality Assessment with Multi-Modality Data	The usefulness of the model, which makes fetal ultrasound more reproducible and less operator dependent.	The authors propose an interesting method, which achieved good results on this particular case, and has great potential for a more widespread application across different medical imaging modalities. The overall score suffered with the lack of clarity on some important details.	The robustness of the proposed method as well as clinical applications are questionable.
517	Tracking by weakly-supervised learning and graph optimization for whole-embryo C. elegans lineages	The work presented in this paper suffers from (i) incremental methodological novelty; (ii) insignificant superiority of the tracking performance compared to the baseline (Linajea); and (iii) very limited performance comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.	This work presents methodology for making the algorithm for lineage tracing in C. elegans data more accurate and easy to use. The methods are valid and clearly presented. However, the added value of the developed methodology is somewhat limited as the 1) It was not possible to assess statistical significance; 2) It is inconsistent with respect to different validation measures; and 3) Improvement on the most-commonly used validation measures (DET and TRA) is marginal. On the other hand, this was enough to climb on the leading position of the dedicated  challenge.	Overall a nicely written paper proposing reasonable extensions to a previously published method. Performance is assessed on three data sets and demonstrates the validity of the performed modifications.
518	TractoFormer: A Novel Fiber-level Whole Brain Tractography Analysis Framework Using Spectral Embedding and Vision Transformers	Novel and useful method even if not the most clearly written paper.	The rating reflects innovation of the approach for of parcellation-free WBT analysis. The merits outweigh the weaknesses.	I have carefully read all part of the paper. Based on the strength and weakness elaborated in Q5, I gave the score.
519	TransEM: Residual Swin-Transformer based regularized PET image reconstruction	The impact of introducing the swin transformer into PET image reconstruction needs to be strengthened in this work. The authors' intention of trying a 'SOTA' model from another field is understandable, and it can be convincing with appropriate demonstration.	It is the first attempt to apply the swim-transformer in PET image reconstruction. Authors combine MLEM and vision transformer together to reduce the noise which is not compromised on image details.	The method is a very good idea, based on two recent state of the art methods. This is totally relevant to try combining them as both are at the cutting edge of PET reconstruction (unrolled methods) and feature extraction (transformers). The work just needs to be more thorough, with a clean way of writing and no mistakes, and more detailed discussion on the results. It lacks a bit of work which is noticeable when reading, but this can be improved to the conference.
520	Transformer based feature fusion for left ventricle segmentation in 4D flow MRI	See main strengths above: it brings a seemingly novel approach (transformer based multimodality learning) to a challenging problem (low quality imaging) to generate convincing results quantified with relevant metrics	"Two major factors affect my recommendation:

The novelty of this application.
The quality of evaluation."	The novelty from application is relatively good.
521	Transformer based multiple instance learning for weakly supervised histopathology image segmentation	Although a weak novelty, the proposed model is motivated by reasonable ideas of modeling correlation of instances of MIL approach for the segmentation task, and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Considering the possibility of application in a wide range of medical image segmentation, I lean toward accepting this paper.	The method is novel in introducing Swin Transformer with deep supervision to pathologic image segmentation. Some comparison and ablation study proved the effectiveness of the method.	The weakly supervised semantic segmentation is interesting. This paper is recommended as acceptance due to the contributions and motivation claimed in the manuscript.
522	Transformer Based Multi-task Deep Learning with Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Model Fitting for Microvascular Invasion Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma	The proposed method, the implementation and the compared results of this papers are good. My only concern is related with the very small dataset.	incremental work from [21].	"Design a transformer-based multi-task learning model
Perform simultaneous IVIM parameter model fitting and MVI prediction
Demonstrate better results with multi-task strategy
No IVIM parameter maps have been shown, which are essential in IVIM applications."
523	Transformer Based Multi-View Network for Mammographic Image Classification	"1.The literature survey is not sufficient to verify the novelty of the method proposed in the article.
2.The logic of the method part is not clear, and the experimental part is not perfect.
3.The English expression of the article needs to be improved."	My major concerns are (1) the description of the shifted window based cross-view attention block is not quite clear, which is a major component of the model; (2) without the results of Swin-T (feature concatenation), we are unable to know how much improvement does the proposed cross-view attention could bring.	Using transformer for multi-view mammographic analysis is natural and seems to be novel.
524	Transformer Lesion Tracker	The novelty and performance is good while got some concerns about the motivation/missing discussion and references.	"The paper presents an interesting method to track lesions over time. The evaluation is based on similar work and shows good results.
Overall, it's good work, but nothing totally groundbreaking either. A discussion is missing and should be added!"	
525	Transforming the Interactive Segmentation for Medical Imaging	Overall results are good, but important details are missing. Also, there are unexpected observations in the comparison with previous methods.	Over all the paper is innovative, but the technical approach needs perhaps a sequence diagram in order to completely understand each part.	This is a very original contribution in the rather niche field of interactive segmentation. The architecture is very generic and it is therefore likely to have a large range of potential applications in the field of medical image segmentation.
526	TransFusion: Multi-view Divergent Fusion for Medical Image Segmentation with Transformers	I think the problem is nicely described. The method seems novel. I am of the opinion that it will generate good discussion. There are some limitations in the way the paper is presented that I have highlighted in my comments for the authors (discuss limitations and provide comparison for computational resources).	The novelty and validation of the proposed method looks good to me. The  paper is well written and structured.	The proposed modules are effective for multi-view inputs and the conducted experiments are solid.
527	TranSQ: Transformer-based Semantic Query for Medical Report Generation	"The paper has a reasonable motivating factor and the proposed approach seems to work very well on the MIMIC-CXR dataset as evidenced by the results compared to the current state of the art.
The authors have conducted an experiment where they provide visual attention maps for each sentence, which is useful as it enables the model to indicate the image regions that lead to its confidence in providing targeted sentence candidates."	A new SOTA on the report generation problem is reached, with thorough comparison to prior work.	The proposed approach is novel and interesting, but some important experiments and implementation details are missing. In particular, the paper did not conduct the ablation study to analyze the contribution of incorporating the existing powerful Vision Transformer (ViT), which may bring significant improvements to performance. So it's unclear how much improvement is brought by the existing ViT and how much improvement is brought by the proposed approach.
528	Trichomonas Vaginalis Segmentation in Microscope Images	Overall, the paper is clearly written. However, the reproducibility is limited since there is no experiments on the public datasets. In addition, the overall methods lack novelty.	The novelty of the proposed dataset is clear and the baseline results are promising, although they should be confirmed with a proper description of the hyperparameters used for every method.	Both dataset and the segmentation method are very convincing.
529	UASSR:Unsupervised Arbitrary Scale Super-resolution Reconstruction of Single Anisotropic 3D images via Disentangled Representation Learning?	"The method presented seems to be novel and valuable. However, the experimental evaluation lacks rigor. The size and importance of the contribution depends on the statistical validity of the output data. The results on table 1 must be clearly explained. If they come from the average of the metrics applied to a population of exams, the authors can add the missing statistical analysis. However, if they come from the application of the method to one single exam, the results can be just a coincidence.
 As this is not clear in the paper, I put it below the line."	"Novelty
Performance
Writing"	The proposed method is interesting and seems useful. Evaluation is a strong plus.
530	ULTRA: Uncertainty-aware Label Distribution Learning for Breast Tumor Cellularity Assessment	Innovative idea - novel architecture with enhanced results compared to state-of-the-art models.	A novel idea to transfer TC score regression to a label distribution learning problem. But the novelty of the proposed method is limited.	Although the idea and clinical importance is interesting, there are too many weakness in the paper for it to be suitable for publication. In particular, statistical analysis should be improved and importance of hyper-parameters that are empirically set investigated.
531	Uncertainty Aware Sampling Framework of Weak-Label Learning for Histology Image Classification	Although some flaws are present in the paper and some improvements have been detailed, the current state of the paper is good enough. The results may not be as good as they could be (mainly due to the amount of WSIs used), but future work could address that and provide an improvement over current alternatives for detecting relevant areas of the WSI.	"-The scale of dataset is small and incomplete for the study.
-Lack comparison with important related works."	The paper uses a well-known method from variational inference to increase efficiency and accuracy in WSI classification. It does not propose a novel method at its core, but presents a solid empirical evaluation of Bayesian methods with a nice application in digital pathology. I vote for accept.
532	Uncertainty-aware Cascade Network for Ultrasound Image Segmentation with Ambiguous Boundary	"There are still several errors in the proposed network, and some experimental results cast doubt on the network's applicability.
Analysis of design ideas or experimental results is lacking."	The proposed components and corresponding experiments seem to be reasonable. Some minor issues should be revised or discussed as mentioned above.	Good and clear introduction, and comprehensive experiment with good performance.
533	Uncertainty-Guided Lung Nodule Segmentation with Feature-Aware Attention	I believe there is merit to this idea and the results seem to confirm that. Clarifications about the experimental evaluation are appreciated though.	Please refer to 5. for more information.	The paper provides a novel solution to integrate all annotations to improve semantic segmentation accuracy. Instead of using VAE to encode the variance, the authors provide an alternative way to implement the uncertainty for annotation via a self-attention model - which is novel. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
534	Undersampled MRI Reconstruction with Side Information-Guided Normalisation	The paper is strong with novelty of the methods and comprehensive datasets for testing.	Overall it is an novel and interesting paper, with a simple but effective design leading to superior results. I would like to see it presenting in the conference.	If the reconstruction network has enough capacity, the benefit of adding the side information seems marginal.
535	UNeXt: MLP-based Rapid Medical Image Segmentation Network	A high performance segmentation method with low computational complexity is a useful contribution; however, this work is not validated against other low computational complexity segmentation methods. Furthermore, many details of the method are not described and the feature map shifting innovation, while novel, is not well motivated or well tested.	"State of the art performance at a fraction of the cost.

Some novelty, although mostly pulling in state of the art methods from vision classification works (ViT and MLP-Mixup), the authors do use these in new ways and even have some added novelties."	See main weaknesses above.
536	Uni4Eye: Unified 2D and 3D Self-supervised Pre-training via Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Ophthalmic Image Classification	The paper contains interesting ideas, experimentation is well conducted, the ablation study might be improved to disentangle the impact of the different image types.	The universality of the approach for ophthalmic images using numerous imaging modalities, as well as both 2D and 3D is very appealing, considering the outperforming results of the model with fine-tuning on several 2D and 3D downstream task, mainly for disease classification. Nevertheless, the lack of methodological novelty in the straightforward self-supervision task using multi-reconstruction with MIM, producing visually moderate results and no quantitative evaluation appears as the main weakness.	The method needs to be better explained.
537	Unified Embeddings of Structural and Functional Connectome via a Function-Constrained Structural Graph Variational Auto-Encoder	-More experiments are needed to prove that the combination of functional and structural connectomes can make the downstream task better. The Presentation and Writing Quality are poor. Not good enough. Limited experiments. Needs more work and/or revisions. I believe it should be rejected.	The novel application of graph VAE model.	"The proposed approach comprehensively employs the functional and structural information is promising.
Further validating the proposed GVAE with the other peer deep neural networks is required; more details and an explanation of the technique should be provided. Moreover, clarify the terminology such as no-nolinearity."
538	Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Image Representations from Ultrasound Videos with Hard Negative Mining	"Quality-wise, the paper is well-motivated, propose an effective method and demonstrate a good performance. And the paper release a dataset.
However, according to the guideline, using \vspace in the paper is strictly prohibited, accepting it would seem unfair to the other paper submissions, I'm happy to change the score, if ACs agree that paper format is not a big deal."	The paper introduces a novel dataset and method for unsupervised representation learning from USG videos. The code is provided, making it reproducible. Even though there are some missing empirical studies, they are not related with the main motivation and can be easily studied. Thus, I will recommend the paper for acceptance.	"I think the proposed method is novel. The experimental setting is sound. The released USG image datasets related to GB malignancy can be useful for future study.
Lastly, expert radiologists are involved in this study."
539	Unsupervised Cross-Disease Domain Adaptation by Lesion Scale Matching	"The better results of using lesion scale matching. 
The authors may need to give a detailed ""Algorithm"" for reproducibility of the work
No comparison with existing domain adaptation methods on batch normalizaiton."	"Crucial problem
Original methodology
Good experimental design"	Please check weakness.
540	Unsupervised Cross-Domain Feature Extraction for Single Blood Cell Image Classification	I believe the idea might be interesting, but the way it is presented and motivated is not very clear.	Novelty of the proposal, results obtained, quality of experimental evaluation.	The baselines are not strong enough, no domain adaptation method is tested as the baseline. The application of this method is limited as the performance on the cross domain are not satisfied. However, the writing of this paper is pretty good.
541	Unsupervised Deep Non-Rigid Alignment by Low-Rank Loss and Multi-Input Attention	Please see the described weaknesses and detailed comments.	Despite the flaws in this paper, the overall method and experiments make some sense for the community, so I recommend weak accept.	"The formulation makes sense and it is natural to achieve best performance.
However, there are some points in the experiments to be clarified."
542	Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Absent Correspondences in Pre-operative and Post-Recurrence Brain Tumor MRI Scans	The proposed method doesn't show clear innovations and contributions over the state-of-the-art methodologies. The performance improvement is incremental. It doesn't seem to have any discussion potential at the conference.	The authors of the paper explain the challenging task of registration of images before and after tumor resection and propose an interesting and well explained novel method facing this problem. The paper is well structured and easy to follow, including an extensive evaluation that lacks only minor clarifications. Overall it is a very well written paper.	This paper presented an unsupervised joint registration and segmentation framework, exploiting a forward-backward consistency constraint to estimate masks and registration fields. The proposed approach has been applied to the BraTS-Reg challenge dataset with performance gains over deep registration methods.
543	Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Contrastive Learning for OCT Segmentation	"No comparison with the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods.
Only one evaluation dataset is utilized."	I tend to weak accept since from one hand it's an interesting method and interesting application, from the other hand, the paper slightly lacks in validation part.	This approach introduces three novel changes to an existing contrastive learning framework, which lead to an improvement of the segmentation performance in an unsupervised domain adaptation scenario. While the method is well presented and the results are sound, the presentation of the results should be improved. Moreover, comparison to more state-of-the-art methods would be interesting.
544	Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Fundus Image Segmentation with Category-level Regularization	"Novel formulations for a category level regularization to deal with aligning subtypes or subcategories efficiently.
The experiments are thorough, and the results are convincing."	The uncleared training process of the model and inadequate experiments	interesting idea but without detailed description and solid experiments.
545	Unsupervised Lesion-Aware Transfer Learning for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading in Ultra-Wide-Field Fundus Photography	Overall the paper has merits and is of interest to the MICCAI community (unsupervised method/use of additional modality/under-explored modality).	The paper idea is relatively novel and also the paper is well-written. Other than some  comments and issues with the results, I believe that this can be a stepping stone for successful and further investigation of this novel imaging system.	The unsupervised transfer task is of great interest, but the manuscript could do with additional clarification, and experiments relating to the direct evaluation of UWF segmentation & against a supervised baseline.
546	Unsupervised Nuclei Segmentation using Spatial Organization Priors	The motivation of the method is clear. Results on 3 datasets demonstrates the effectiveness.	The paper bears some novelty. The experimental results has some gaps compared to supervised and semi-supervised method, but looks promising for unsupervised methods.	The idea is novel and well presented. The description is clear. The results are significantly better than reference SOTA methods, and based on 3 very different datasets. Overall, the presented novel unsupervised method for nuclei segmentation that can learn from H&E and then can be used for IHC-stained tissue images is very promising for the computational pathology.
547	Unsupervised Representation Learning of Cingulate Cortical Folding Patterns	The paper attempt to tackle a challenging task while the interpretation of results, conclusion and possible application are not well presented.	The topic is interesting. However, This paper is lack of completeness as I mentioned above.	The research topic is novel and of great importance, and the methods are reasonable.
548	Usable Region Estimate for Assessing Practical Usability of Medical Image Segmentation Models	The proposed metrics have potential and it is an important problem. However, the evaluation does not demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metrics over existing work. The results are also dependent upon parameter selection, which can make the results unstable and hard to interpret.	The paper propose a novel evaluation metric that quantify the model correctness and confidence in an unified way. The paper is generally well-written. Further discussion and justification on the limitation and experiment evaluation may help improve the paper.	It is not clear why these indices should give more information on the model performance than existing indices
549	USG-Net: Deep Learning-based Ultrasound Scanning-Guide for an Orthopedic Sonographer	Lack of clarity in many areas, lack of adequate comparison with other work or manual approaches.	"Clear contributions in novel task,
Well-written, but the problem formulation is lack and general design of experiments are missed.
More methods should be compared, as only the proposed method and its variants are compared."	Overall, I think that the work presented will be of interest to the MICCAI community, providing a creative combination of deep-learning approaches to address a clinically relevant topic. The justification of the need for a new method and details of its implementation could be stronger.
550	Using Guided Self-Attention with Local Information for Polyp Segmentation	This paper shows good example of transformer and CNN.	This paper propose a novel transformer block for polyp segmentation and advance the SOTA considerably. On the other hand, the paper lack analysis on model size and inference speed, which weaken the comparison results with prior models.	I found the paper was well written, all contributions were explicit and clear, and the motivation was also clearly presented. The structure is good, the figures are helpful. I would have liked to see a stronger effort on reproducibility, and statistical analysis of the reported metrics. I am not happy with many of the claims in the reproducibility checklist, which don't correspond to what can be found in the manuscript.
551	USPoint: Self-Supervised Interest Point Detection and Description for Ultrasound-Probe Motion Estimation during Fine-Adjustment Standard Fetal Plane Finding	The major factors is the seemingly limited practical value of the proposed method in the application of standard plane finding. Also the proposed method seems to have some fundamental design issues that should be addressed by the authors. The novelty is slightly limited also considering all of the individual modules exist in the previous works.	I think the work is quite good although the organization is a bit haphazard.	There is a good contribution in the paper but a few modification should be made including loss function, the self-supervised term.
552	Vector Quantisation for Robust Segmentation	In the case of a single domain, the increase in performance is not very clearly explained, which casts doubt on the technique. I am open to increase my rating if my questions and doubts are answered.	The author claims that by introduing VQ can effectively solve the problem of domain shift in  medical images. However, either the theorical assumptions or experiments could prove this claim.	This work shows that the quantized low-dimensional space in the encoder of autoencoder-like networks is beneficial to gain robustness. Authors show this via trustworthy experiments.
553	Video-based Surgical Skills Assessment using Long term Tool Tracking	It think the work in this paper is interesting. However, the points I outlined in my review above need to be addressed properly for the paper to be really useful for the readers in my view.	Lack of comparison with previous contributions in video-based tracking of surgical tools.	"The contribution is novel and relevant to the community.
There is a reported data annotation effort.
However, comparison with the right baselines is missing."
554	Vision-Language Contrastive Learning Approach to Robust Automatic Placenta Analysis Using Photographic Images	The authors provide a pilot work on multi-modalities (image and medical reports) contrastive learning for placenta image analysis.	i think the method is interesting, particularly with joint image-language contrastive learning. They also introduces a new loss function which seems to do better than the standard loss function on their dataset.	The method is interesting but the evaluation and results interesting could have been optimized (more runs, qualitative results, better discussion).
555	Visual deep learning-based explanation for neuritic plaques segmentation in Alzheimer's Disease using weakly annotated whole slide histopathological images	Deep learning models with explainability features have not yet been applied in tau segmentation from WSIs. The authors develops baseline Deep learning method for this application. The clinical significance of the method is not thoroughly discussed and compared with trivial methods.	I would like to see more description of why this work is important and why others have not previously done it.	I think it is important to facilitate data and code sharing and this paper can help to this.
556	Visual explanations for the detection of diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images	Novelty and experimental results.	The work is interesting but lacks novelty.	The paper spends most of its effort on proposing a saliency map approach that doesn't outperform already available ones. Although this is not a problem in itself, the paper doesn't do extensive analysis on this which would make it of scientific (rather than technical) interest. The area of more technical interest (i.e. the ensembling approach) also doesn't receive enough attention (e.g. ablation studies, clinically meaningful visualisation, etc...) to be of sufficient interest to a MICCAI reader in its own right.
557	vMFNet: Compositionality Meets Domain-generalised Segmentation	The compositional network with vMF is novel and has not been used to address the domain generalization problems in the literature. The decomposition by vMF kernels can serve as a potential alternative to content-style disentanglement and may be applied to the field of image harmonization and etc. The paper is well-written and make reviewer easy to follow. The experiments are well designed and the visualization of the compositionality provides more insights to the readers about the vMF kernels.	The paper brings an interesting concept of component compositionality for domain generalization, and shows the advantage of the method compared to recent baselines. However, the motivation of the method and its loss terms needs clarification.	I believe that the compositionality idea is very interesting from the point of view of domain generalization, and the authors have developed, presented and evaluated the method very nicely. This paper will make a fantastic addition to the conference, in my opinion.
558	Vol2Flow: Segment 3D Volumes using a Sequence of Registration Flows	The idea is novel and useful to improve the effective utilization of medical datasets.	The paper has certain novelty and the performance is good and convincing.	The method is limited in applicability since it is based on the assumption that a displacement field exists between the 2D slices, which is rarely true. It also seems to over-complicate the task of producing registration if displacement field is desired.    A fair comparison with a better deformable image registration algorithms (non-deep learning) should be able to accomplish the same task without any training, which would be much simpler.
559	Warm Start Active Learning with Proxy Labels & Selection via Semi-Supervised Fine-Tuning	Proper paper presentation and a more robust experimental section are lacking.	The method is good. The results are good. Explaining the experiment setting should be minor changes.	"The presented method proposed a methodology that tackled the problem at hand i.e. cold-start annotation / active learning and exploitation of unlabelled data for better annotation candidates
The paper is well written but some parts of the results could have had a better exploration and discussion"
560	WavTrans: Synergizing Wavelet and Cross-Attention Transformer for Multi-Contrast MRI Super-resolution	The idea of this paper is technically sound and reasonable. Specifically, a joint wavelet and residual cross-attention swin transformer network is proposed for multi-contrast MR SR problem. Comprehensive experiments including comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and ablation study show the effectiveness of the proposed method. They also evaluate their method in 2 different datasets, one is in-house brain dataset, the other is public fastMRI knee dataset, which show the generalizability of the proposed method.	strong methodology, good results	This paper is well organized.
561	Weakly Supervised MR-TRUS Image Synthesis for Brachytherapy of Prostate Cancer	I think this thesis is probably below the threshold for acceptance. The main problem lies in the structure of the paper, the lack of necessary ablation experiment, and the qualitative effect is not particularly good.	"Coping with low soft tissue contrast and visualization of the tumor in the prostate region is a difficult task.
The paper presents a method that synthesizes TRUS images from unpaired MR images.
No major revision is required but improvement could be on clarifying the MR image pattern extraction which is very technical."	The proposed method is novel with most of the specification provided. Using weakly supervised learning for prostate segmentation on MRI resolves the issue of lacking prostate labels.
562	Weakly Supervised Online Action Detection for Infant General Movements	The method is interesting, but the method description contains unclear parts, and the results are plausible except for the early classification (requiring shorter video).	It is the same as the answer to question 8. The ablation results do not sufficiently show the strength of the design of the proposed model. In particular, it seems that more diverse experimental designs and analyses are needed for action detection. In addition, if there was an in-depth analysis of the ablation result, a better evaluation would be possible.	"The paper presented a framework based on weekly supervised learning method, which can solve the data scarcity problem in medical image processing. 
The authors had demonstrated clinical feasibility. 
The problem solved in this manuscript is of great clinical importance.
The techniques used in this manuscript are reasonable.
The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow."
563	Weakly Supervised Segmentation by Tensor Graph Learning for Whole Slide Images	The paper is interesting and well-written. While the main idea is not new, the proposed solution seems to be well-engineered with some additional tricks.  The evaluation is generally good, but has some limitations in terms of comparison methods and computational cost.	The results may be strong however the explanation of the methodology is very poor compare to other papers in the stack and many concepts remain unclear after multiple attempts of re-reading.	Novelty and Experiment
564	Weakly Supervised Volumetric Image Segmentation with Deformed Templates	The paper is good but I am not convinced that the image reconstruction step is the right thing to do here.	"This paper propose a complete and feasible pipeline with considerable technical novelty to the important problem of weakly supervised volumetric image
segmentation."	This is an interesting idea, definitely worth exploring. Unfortunately the paper doesn't explain the actually set up clearly - is this something done one image at a time, or is a model trained on a set of images?    This is something that could easily be fixed by the authors.
565	Weakly-supervised Biomechanically-constrained CT/MRI Registration of the Spine	the proposed method and loss functions appear to outperform previous methods.	The idea is interesting but need more experiments.	A good work with comprehensive evaluation. But it can benefit from more methodology development and in-depth analysis.
566	Weakly-supervised High-fidelity Ultrasound Video Synthesis with Feature Decoupling	The paper proposes an interesting framework for US imaging that can be used in other domains as well.	The practical use of the proposed weekly-supervised approach in US synthesis could be impactful. The paper is well-written and the proposed model has achieved clear improvements over SOTAs.	The major concern lie in the novelty part.
567	Weighted Concordance Index Loss-based Multimodal Survival Modeling for Radiation Encephalopathy Assessment in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiotherapy	The author had too little comparison in the experimental part, which is not conducive to comparison with the current methods in this field at home and abroad.	The paper looks solid: proper review of related study and sound experiment result. I am not familiar with the task of radiation encephalopathy assessment and survival model. But based on the presentation of method and result, I vote for weak accept.	The authors presented implemented a model with to predict the future risk of an unwanted injury due to radiotherapy. Having knowledge of this risk prior to treatment would allow clinicians to modify their plans to reduce the risk. The paper was well organized and has many strengths as described above. The weaknesses are minor.
568	What can we learn about a generated image corrupting its latent representation?	Nowadays, many works on medical image processing using GANs for data augmentation or modality translation. But sometimes it doesn't bring more useful information. This paper can bring benefits to the community and give these works a reference.	The idea is new and interesting. But more convincing results are necessary.	"The novelty of the idea - somehow novel.
The completeness of the experiment settings - the visualisation of the relationship between uncertainty maps and the segmentation is hard to follow. The relationship betweent hem is not very strong. Maybe authors need to find a new way to demonstrate how to use this uncertainty estimation technique.
The clarity and organisation of the paper - the organisation is very good."
569	What Makes for Automatic Reconstruction of Pulmonary Segments	Even though the topic is interesting, but the novelty of contribution is limited.	I really like the rigorous problem statement and the idea of the continuous border assessment.	The study has clearly clinical impacts, however, some details need to be clarified
570	White Matter Tracts are Point Clouds: Neuropsychological Score Prediction and Critical Region Localization via Geometric Deep Learning	The novelty of representing microstructure measurements of white matter trajectories as point clouds weighed most heavily in the decision to accept the paper. The performance of the method compared to the baseline cannot be evaluated properly, as no statics are published.	New issue in the dMRI field. Promising in clinical analysis.	The point-cloud deep network and the paired-Siamese loss are new for the task of neuropsychological score prediction. The network is simple and highly interpretable. The point-wise feature representation learned by the network is used to derive the critical region localization algorithm, which is shown to be able to detect the functional regions corresponding to the neuropsychological measure.
571	Whole Slide Cervical Cancer Screening Using Graph Attention Network and Supervised Contrastive Learning	The method is technically sound and intelligible.	The authors mentioned the importance of whole slide images, but there is no evidence of using whole slide images in their manuscript. The authors didn't include qualitative image-based results.  Hence, it is hard to decide if the analysis is correct or wrong. Technical novelty is none or limited. The authors worked on Graph Attention Network and Contrastive Learning. These approaches may be new to the healthcare domain but have been used in other image analysis platforms. Hence, the author's technical novel contribution is limited. In Fig. 2, two different types of images have been used. The image in Slide seems H&Es, which doesn't match with tile images. It will be better if the authors introduce their data first. Then show their qualitative results in whole slide images. There is no clue on how the screening will be performed. The t-SNE plot is not sufficient as a performance measure.  The manuscript lacks sufficient qualitative and quantitative evidence. The authors should share the	This paper proposes a graph attention network for WSIs classification. Relationships between suspicious patches are utilized. The loss function is the combination of cross-entropy loss and a loss based on supervised contrastive learning. The method proposed reaches the best performance compared with other methods. The clarity and organization are good in this paper.
572	Why patient data cannot be easily forgotten?	I may argue for accepting the paper because it is thought provoking and may stimulate interesting discussions.	The paper addresses an important aspect of AI in healthcare and is of great interest to the MICCAI community. Although I see some room for improvement, I recommend acceptance.	"Weak empirical validation. Detailed recommendations for improvement are provided in the ""paper weaknesses"" part of the review."
573	XMorpher: Full Transformer for Deformable Medical Image Registration via Cross Attention	The proposed full transformer architecture utilized the dual parallel feature extraction networks, which exchanged information through cross attention, discovering multi-level semantic correspondence for effective registration. The proposed XMorpher has shown performance gains over existing deep registration models in DMIR.	The idea and results are satisfactory.	The paper has a certain innovations, and the experiments also show the improvement of the proposed method compare to baseline models. Although some weakness exists, it can be accepted after correction.
574	Y-Net: A Spatiospectral Dual-Encoder Network for Medical Image Segmentation	-- The authors evaluate a the proposed method with proper comparison to existed methods in the literature. The validation in the paper justifies the contribution of the proposed framework.	The	The novelty of the proposed method and rationality of experiments.
