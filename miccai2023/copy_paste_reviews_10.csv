029-Paper0501	A Style Transfer-based Augmentation Framework for Improving Segmentation and Classification Performance across Different Sources in Ultrasound Images			Insufficient Dataset Description: The authors have not provided an adequate description of the dataset utilized in the study, which may hinder the reader's understanding of the context and the applicability of the proposed method. Furthermore, the lack of information regarding the preprocessing steps implemented in the research could adversely affect the reproducibility of the method, thereby limiting its potential adoption by other researchers. Disorganized Introduction Section: The Introduction section of the paper appears to be lacking in organization and clarity, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the importance and motivation behind the proposed method. A well-structured Introduction that clearly outlines the research problem, its significance, and the authors' approach to addressing it is crucial for setting the context and engaging the readers. Inadequate Description of Previous Methods: While the paper compares the proposed method with earlier approaches in the field, the authors have not provided sufficient information about these previous methods. A brief but informative overview of the earlier approaches would have been valuable in helping the reader understand the limitations of existing methods and the reasons behind the development of the proposed method. This additional context would further emphasize the novelty and potential benefits of the authors' work. Addressing these weaknesses in the paper would greatly enhance its overall quality and increase its potential to make a meaningful contribution to the existing body of literature in the field		Insufficient Dataset Description: The authors have not provided an adequate description of the dataset utilized in the study, which may hinder the reader's understanding of the context and the applicability of the proposed method.

064-Paper0383	Anatomy-Driven Pathology Detection on Chest X-rays			The authors proposed a new approach called Anatomy-driven Pathology Detection for automatic interpretation of medical scans, particularly chest X-rays, by detecting and delineating pathological regions. The authors address the scarcity of large public datasets for pathology detection by using easy-to-annotate bounding boxes of anatomical regions as proxies for pathologies. They compare two training approaches: supervised training using anatomy-level pathology labels and multiple instance learning (MIL) with image-level pathology labels. The article is well written and easy to understand, however there are typos and grammatical errors. It would be nice if the authors could fix them. The authors used 2 public datasets and the approach explained quite well which makes it feasible to reproduce. The paper seems convincing. The authors provide quite good ablation study that justifies the design of the proposed approach. The selected architectures like DenseNet is a little bit outdated and could be replaced by more recent ones (SE-ResNext, EfficientNet, etc.). Overall, the paper is good.

111-Paper2489	Certification of Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation			The paper proposes a method for certified segmentation in medical imaging using randomized smoothing and diffusion probabilistic models. The method involves training a denoising diffusion probabilistic model and using it in conjunction with randomized smoothing to obtain state-of-the-art results in certified segmentation. The paper also presents a comprehensive study on certified segmentation for medical imaging. The authors employed public datasets and the paper is easy to follow and understand, so it seems reproducible. The authors' contributions are not clearly stated in the introduction. There is no ablation study for the proposed method. The proposed method involves training a denoising diffusion probabilistic model, which is an iterative process that can be computationally expensive. The proposed method involves combining randomized smoothing with a diffusion probabilistic model, which may make the method more complex and difficult to understand for some readers. While the paper discusses some of the limitations of randomized smoothing and diffusion probabilistic models, it could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations of the proposed method. Overall, the approach seems interesting and novel.			The paper proposes a method for certified segmentation in medical imaging using randomized smoothing and diffusion probabilistic models.

161-Paper2090	CXR-CLIP: Toward Large Scale Chest X-ray Language-Image Pre-training		The presentation should be improved. This article seems to be written in a bit of a hurry, and there is a lot of scope for improving the presentation of the paper. There are lots of abbreviations in the main text. I recommend the authors only abbreviate the important terms. For example, it is better to give a detailed description (or a full name) of TCL and ICL in the Abstract. The proposed TCL and ICL are not novel. The image-only contrastive learning has been widely explored in literature. The text-only contrastive learning has been widely explored in NLP and several medical image-text pre-training papers, e.g., [1]. The experiment should be improved. Lots of newly published works [2][3] are missing. I strongly recommend the authors compare the proposed approach with these existing works. I would like to see a statistical significance test, due to the performance gap between the proposed approach and the previous state-of-the-art methods is small. Besides, the statistical significance test can eliminate the rand. impact of few-shot settings. The analysis is poor. The analysis doesn't provide insights about the contributions of each component or how that affects the final results/addresses the claimed problems (and why). The paper is written in an optimistic tone that leads the reader to assume the proposed approach is rather good. However, I am more interested in knowing if the approach brings errors. And what type of errors does it bring? And why? References: [1] Making the Most of Text Semantics to Improve Biomedical Vision-Language Processing. ECCV, 2022.

214-Paper1730	Diversity-preserving Chest Radiographs Generation from Reports in One Stage		The paper proposes a diversity-preserving method called DivXGAN, which generates high-fidelity and diverse chest radiographs from radiology reports using a one-stage generator and a domain-specific hierarchical text encoder. The method is evaluated on two datasets and shown to facilitate supervised downstream applications via a multi-label classification task. The authors provide ablation study and comparison with other approaches. The authors used public datasets and the paper is easy to follow, so the approach should be reproducible. The contributions of the paper are not clearly stated in the Introduction. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method, such as the potential biases introduced by the training data and the generalization ability of the model to unseen data. The paper does not provide a thorough discussion on the ethical implications of generating medical images from radiology reports and the potential risks associated with the misuse of such technology.

444-Paper0826	Multi-Modal Semi-supervised Evidential Recycle Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Classification		The paper lacks a fair discussion on the shortcomings of typically used approaches. The overall discussion in introduction offers much room for improvement by defining all these issues and limitations to define the worth of the proposed methodology. It would be helpful if you could provide more information about the data used in your study, including the data collection procedures, data cleaning and preprocessing methods, and any relevant information about the variables used in the analysis. By including this information, you can increase the transparency and credibility of your research and allow other researchers to build upon your work. While conclusion is concise, it would benefit from further development and elaboration. I suggest expanding on the information provided in the captions to ensure that readers can fully comprehend the content of the figures. This may include additional details on the data being presented, the variables being analyzed, or any key findings or trends that are visible in the figure. Providing this information will enhance the reader's understanding of the figure and its relevance to the research. While tables can be an effective way to present data, they should be designed to be easily readable and understandable for the reader. I suggest revising the tables to make them less crowded and heavy. This could include simplifying the layout, using appropriate headings and subheadings to organize the information, and breaking up large blocks of text into more manageable sections. Additionally, consider using formatting techniques such as bolding to highlight key information or trends.
