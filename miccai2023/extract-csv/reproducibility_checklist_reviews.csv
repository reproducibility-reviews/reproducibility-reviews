128-Paper1979	Collaborative modality generation and tissue segmentation for early-developing macaque brain MR images	reproducibility		The authors claim will release the code in the checklist. The dataset is public. The study is reproducible.	
132-Paper1939	Community-Aware Transformer for Autism Prediction in fMRI Connectome	reproducibility		No major issues. Don't seem to be able to find the average runtime despite it being mentioned in the checklist, would have been useful to have it mentioned somewhere in the paper or readme.	
151-Paper0363	Cortical analysis of heterogeneous clinical brain MRI scans for large-scale neuroimaging studies	reproducibility	The checklist indicates that descriptions of algorithms, models, hyper-parameters, failure modes, etc are available.  If provided with this information, the reproducibility of the paper should be high.

245-Paper1308	EoFormer: Edge-oriented Transformer for Brain Tumor Segmentation	reproducibility	The authors provided a table with some design details of the proposed EoFormer network. The architecture and implementation details are clear. However there is no link or reference to any code. The authors stated that the code will be provided in the reproducibility checklist, along with all the information.  Information about datasets have been included in the paper.		
247-Paper0986	Estimated time to surgical procedure completion: An exploration of video analysis methods	reproducibility		The reproducibility checklist for the dataset is not coherent with the paper. On the checklist, it is mentioned that the information for the public dataset is provided, but the paper does not mention the use of such datasets. Furthermore, the checklist specified that the items were not applicable to new dataset, whereas the paper presents a new dataset, and the description is incomplete (see comments).	
279-Paper1053	FocalUNETR: A Focal Transformer for Boundary-aware Prostate Segmentation using CT Images	reproducibility	I saw in the reproducibility checklist that the authors do not plan to release trained models. I think the weights of the models trained on public datasets should be released to easier the comparison to future works. In addition, information on the statistical significance of reported differences in performance between evaluated methods, the average runtime, and the memory footprint for each approach should also be reported in the paper.		
282-Paper0231	Foundation Ark: Accruing and Reusing Knowledge for Superior and Robust Performance	reproducibility	The paper seems to be reproducible according to the checklist.		
298-Paper1981	Generating High-Resolution 3D CT with 12-bit Depth using a Diffusion Model with Adjacent Slice and Intensity Calibration Network	reproducibility		The response of reproducibility checklist is marked as NA. However, I believe author/s should complete section 1 for the algorithm reproducibility.	
305-Paper1904	GLSFormer : Gated - Long, Short Sequence Transformer for Step Recognition in Surgical Videos	reproducibility		The authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission, which is a positive sign for the reproducibility of their work. They have provided detailed information about their experimental setup and evaluation metrics, as well as links to the datasets used in this study. However, while they state that code will be made publicly available after the review process, it is not currently available at the time of publication. Overall, based on the information provided in their checklist and paper itself regarding data availability and experimental details, it seems that reproducing this work would be feasible with some effort. However, without access to code or more detailed implementation instructions beyond what was included in their paper, full reproducibility may be challenging for some readers.	
332-Paper0546	Importance Weighted Variational Cardiac MRI Registration Using Transformer and Implicit Prior	reproducibility	"Use of public datasets. While numbers of training/test splits are reported, given these are public datasets it would be helpful to refer to the actual cases. Results are quantitatively reported, with mean/stdev, and metric referred to, bur there is, in contrary what the authors state in their checklist, no ""An analysis of statistical significance of reported differences in performance between methods."""

461-Paper2286	MUVF-YOLOX: A Multi-modal Ultrasound Video Fusion Network for Renal Tumor Diagnosis	reproducibility	The authors use an internal dataset. In the checklist, they select to provide the codes, data, and model. However, these informations do not appear in the paper.		
483-Paper2143	PAS-Net: Rapid Prediction of Antibiotic Susceptibility from Fluorescence Images of Bacterial Cells Using Parallel Dual-branch Network	reproducibility		According to the  answers to the reproducibility checklist, there will be no code to be released, which makes the reproducibility of the paper a little challenge.	
494-Paper0128	PET-diffusion: Unsupervised PET Enhancement based on the Latent Diffusion Model	reproducibility	reproducibility is very poor both datasets and model are not published. The author's reproducibility checklist is inconsistent with the actual paper.		
510-Paper0987	Prediction of Cognitive Scores by Joint Use of Movie-watching fMRI Connectivity and Eye Tracking via Attention-CensNet	reproducibility	According to the reproducibility checklist, the reproducibility of the paper is acceptable.		
533-Paper3264	Reflectance Mode Fluorescence Optical Tomography with Consumer-Grade Cameras	reproducibility	After carefully examining the reproducibility checklist submitted by the authors and considering the requirements for reproducibility, I must state that reproducing the results of this paper may be difficult. While the authors have provided a detailed methodology and experimental setup, they have not included code or data to support the results. Without access to the data and code, it may be challenging to reproduce the experiments described in the paper. Additionally, some of the experiments rely on proprietary software or tools that may not be easily accessible to others. Furthermore, the paper lacks a clear description of the hardware and software used in the experiments, which could affect the ability to reproduce the results. Additionally, there is no mention of the version control system used to manage the code and data, which could make it difficult to track changes and reproduce specific versions of the experiments. In summary, while the authors have made efforts to ensure the reproducibility of their results, the lack of code and data, as well as some missing details about the experimental setup, may make reproducing the experiments challenging.
