663-Paper3122	Tracking adaptation to improve SuperPoint for 3D reconstruction in endoscopy				The paper appears reproducible, with clear reference to the training data, software and methods used. The reproducibility checklist implies that code will be released for this method, however this is not mentioned in the paper. The intention may be to add this sentence to the camera ready version.

695-Paper1729	Unsupervised Discovery of 3D Hierarchical Structure with Generative Diffusion Features			"Reproducibility is rather weak and significantly lower as promised in the reproducibility checklist. The checklist contains only ""yes""es, even at questions that are not applicable for this work. However, the manuscript is missing many of the promised information, such as description of the compute hardware, A description of results with central tendency (e.g. mean) & variation, Details on how baseline methods were implemented and tuned, A description of the memory footprint, Discussion of clinical significance, The average runtime for each result, or estimated energy cost, a note that code will be released and more."

708-Paper2976	VISA-FSS: A Volume-Informed Self Supervised Approach for Few-Shot 3D Segmentation				The authors answered no to all questions in the reproducibility checklist. This means that the author would not release any code. Although the authors claimed all hyper parameters and protocols are following [18], it would be difficult to reproduce entirely the results. Especially, the registration module is not thoroughly discussed. However, the idea is well explained, means it would not be difficult to test the similar idea in other applications.

709-Paper2328	Vision Transformer based Multi-Class Lesion Detection in IVOCT		As pointed out in the weaknesses section, the reproducibility checklist is fully checked while information on publishing data, code or ethics approval are not mentioned in the manuscript. Furthermore, no information on hyperparameters is given in the paper which makes reproducibility of the results very difficult.		It is really hard to comment on the reproducibility, as the statements between the reproducibility checklist and the actual paper are in completely opposite directions.  If one purely looks at the paper it is as poor as it gets: No public data, no public code, no details on the data split, no details on the value ranges for the data augmentation, etc. Looking at the reproducibility checklist all of that will be provided.
