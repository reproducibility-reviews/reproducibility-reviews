\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
The reproducibility section of the reviews was in general extremely short (median length: $16.0$ words; inter-quartile range [IQR]: $18.0$ words).
For readers to get a more concrete idea of the amount of information it represents, we display some randomly picked reviews which length falls between the $40^{th}$ and $60^{th}$ centile in~\autoref{tab:40_60}.
Note that $30\%$ of reviews contain less than 10 words (see some randomly chosen examples in~\autoref{tab:0_30}).
The full descriptive statistics of the different sections of the reviews is provided in~\autoref{tabS:words} and the corresponding histograms are available here\footnote{\url{https://github.com/reproducibility-reviews/reproducibility-reviews/blob/main/supplementary_figures.pdf}}.
