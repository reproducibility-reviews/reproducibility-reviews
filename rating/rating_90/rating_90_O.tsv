(-/+) comments	The paper provides a detailed description of the methods and techniques used to implement the AR2T rendering framework, including the transfer functions, phase functions, and voxelization process. Additionally, the paper provides examples of the rendered images, as well as a convergence criterion for the iterative process.  However, the paper does not provide the exact data sets used for the experiments, making it difficult to reproduce the results. Furthermore, while the authors mention evaluating the framework's speed and quality, they do not provide any quantitative measurements or benchmarks for comparison with other approaches. Finally, the availability of the executable to the research community for further evaluation and comparison is currently under evaluation, which may limit reproducibility.  Therefore, while the paper provides a detailed description of the methods used, there are some weaknesses in terms of reproducibility, making it difficult to fully evaluate the framework's effectiveness and compare it with other approaches.	1	0	1	1	0	0	2.

(none) statement	2. (-) comments	Codes are provided.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1. (none) statement	3. (+) comments	The diffusion method is slow due to the large number of samplings. However, the paper does not provide a direct comparison of ArtiFusion's speed to existing methods. However, the authors do mention that the proposed method is computationally expensive due to the large number of samplings required by the diffusion process.  To address this issue, the authors propose a time token scheme that reduces the number of samplings required during training and inference. Additionally, they use a Swin-Transformer denoising architecture that is designed to capture local-global correlations in regional artifact restoration more efficiently than other architectures.  While there is no direct comparison of ArtiFusion's speed to existing methods, the authors do report that their proposed method achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based methods on a public histological dataset. Therefore, while ArtiFusion may be computationally expensive due to its use of diffusion-based artifact restoration, it is still able to achieve promising results in terms of accuracy and preservation of tissue structures and stain style in artifact-free regions during restoration.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.

120-Paper1961	CLIP-Lung: Textual Knowledge-Guided Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction	Since the data is public and the test is performed with only one dataset, tests can be reimplemented and diversified by adding different datasets. Furthermore, this model can be developed and varied using different text attributes. Since information or data sources can be extended and varied by making visual representations from text annotations, similar techniques can be developed to be used in different fields.  However, since the model code is private, this will significantly affect the reproducibility or reusability of the methods. It will be challenging to produce all those identical inferences since they tested the model with too many subsets of the same data and all combinations of different loss functions.	0	1	1	1	0	0	1.
